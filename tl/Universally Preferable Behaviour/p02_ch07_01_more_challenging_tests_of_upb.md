## Maraming mapanghamong mga pagsusuri ng UPB

Ngayon ay sinubukan nating tiyakin na ang mga teyorya ng moral na may kaugnayan sa balangkas ng UPB ay napagtibay natin ang pinaka-karaniwang mga paniniwala sa moral, tulad ng mga probihisyon laban sa panggagahasa, pagpinsala at pang-uumit. Batay sa pagpapadala ng kriterya ng *maiwasan* sa ating pag-susuri, kami ay nakakatulong din sa pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng mga patayan ng hindi pwedeng maiwasan, at ang mga patayan ay kailangan na pairalin ang positibong pagkilos, gaya ng panlilinlang. Sa wakas, hinati-hati namin ang "mas mabuting pag-uugali" sa mga kategorya ng tatlong pangunahin - unibersal, binago ang at niyutral (at ang mga kanilang ugnyan sa mga kasaliwaan). Ang mga ipinagbabawal na gawain sa buong daigdig ay kinabibilangan ng panggagahasa, pagpinsala at pang-uumit, na pwedeng gawin para mapigilan. Kasama sa mga kagustuhan ng aesthetically na higit na mabuti ang pagkamagalang, ang pagiging maagap sa oras at iba pa, na hindi pwedeng ipatupad sa pamamagitan ng kalupitan. Kasama ang mga niyutral na pag-aksyon ang mga pansariling kagustuhan, o ang mga aksyon na walang moral na nakapaloob, gaya ng pag-andar ng bus.

Gayunman, merong maraming mananatiling mahihirap na pagsusulit sa moral na nasa labas ng mga halimbawa kami ay nakipag-ugnayan sa itaas. Kami lamang ay makakaapekto sa ilang mga narito, para makita ang balangkas ng UPB, at silipin kung paano ito nakikipag-kasundo sa mga mas na tanung sa moral na ito.

### Sariling-pagtatanggol

Ang konsepto ng pangsariling pagtatanggol ay hindi dapat bawiin. Kung inaakala namin na walang ganon na bagay tulad ng sariling-pagtatanggol, o ang pangsariling-pangtatanggol sa sarili ay talagang hindi balidong pagkilos, at tsaka ang balangkas ng UPB ay nagbabawal sa palagay na sobrang bilis.

Kung inaakala namin na walang ganon na bagay tulad ng sariling-pagtatanggol, tsaka ay hindi namin tinatalakay ang ukol sa pagtanggap sa bagong kasapi o ang paghihiganti sa paggamit ng lakas, subali't sa halip lamang ang paggamit ng lakas sa kahit anumang konteksto. Sa ibang salita, kung aalisin natin ang konsepto ng pangsariling-pagtatanggol, ang tanong lamang na kailangan naming itanung sa aming sarili na: *ang paggamit ba ng pwersa ay mabuti o hindi?*

Kung iyan ay mas mabuting gamitin ang pwersa ng lahat, tsaka walang sino man ang dapat magpatuloy sa isang moral na argumento, ngunit dapat sa halip ay gumamit ng pwersa para makuha ang kanyang mga layunin. Gayunman, gaya ng sa panggagahasa, pang-uumit at pagpinsala ay mga halimbawa na binanggit sa itaas, ang pagkuha na ito ay higit na mas mabuti na gamitin ang pwersa ay mabilis na nagpawalang-halaga sa sarili nito. Para magamit ang pwersa sa ibang tao ay kinakailangan na ang taong iyon ay magpapatunay - sa ibang mga salita, para sa isang tao na maging moral, ang ibang tao ay kailangan na imoral, na hindi pwedeng tumaya. Pati, kung ang ibang tao *ay nagpasa* ng pwersa, ito ay hindi pwersa - kaya kailangan siya ay *labanan*, na kinakailangan na labanan niya ang birtud para paganahin ang birtud, na kung saan ay nagkakasalungatan sa sarili.

Sa karagdagan, kung ito ay palaging mas mabuting gamitin ng pwersa, tsaka ang mga krimen gaya ng panggahasa at patayan ay hindi naaangkop, sapagkat kung palaging mas mabuti na gumamit ng pwersa, tsaka ang pagmamahal ay nagiging imoral, at ang panggahasa ay nagiging moral - subali't para lamang iyon sa mga manggagahasa, habang *pagpasa* sa kalupitan, sa halip na ang kalupitan mismo, ang kanyang biktima ay nagiging moral, na kung saan ay isang pagkakasalungat.

Kung, sa kabilang banda, ipinpahayag namin na ang kalupitan ay masama, kung gayon ay binuksan namin ang posibilidad ng pansariling-pagtatanggol kung ito ay isang ulat ng UPB na nagpapahayag na ang kalupitan ay masama, alam namin na, saka ang masama ay pwedeng piitin sa pamamagitan ng paggamit ng kalupitan, ang paggamit sa kaharasan sa *labanan* ang kaharasan ay moral na balido.

Samakatuwid, dahil sa ala, namin na ang kalupitan ay masama, alam namin na pwedeng naming gamitin ang pwersa para labanan ito. Kung depinihin namin na ang isang pag-aksyon ay tulad ng kasamaan, subali't mapipigilan din ng kahit sinuman na kumilos laban dito. samakatuwid ay hindi na tayo ang mga moral na pilosopo, subali't ang mahusay na mga arkeyologo lang. Ito ay magiging kagaya sa isaang teyorya na medesina na nagpapahayag na ang nararamdaman ay masama, subali't masama ang pagtatangka para maiwasan o malunasan ito - na kung saan ito ay walang kahulugan kung ano pa man.

Pati, kung ang mga tao ay hindi balido para kumilos para maiwasan ang pagpatay sa kanilang mga sarili, tsaka ang mga aksyon gaya ng mga iniksiyon, pagsusuot ng guwantes sa malamig, ang sunscreen ay ilagay o pangpuksa sa insekto, ang paglagay ng isang pader para maiwasan ang pagguho ng lupa, magsipilyo ng ngipin, pagsusuot ng sapatos at ang lahat ng iba pang mga imoral na pag-asksyon. Kung bumalik kami sa bob at doug, at bibigyan natin sila ng argumento ng moral na pansariling-pagtatanggol ay laging mali, ano kaya ang mga resulta?

Buweno, kami ay gumawa ng isa pang kabalighuan. Ang pansariling-pagtatanggol ay ang paggamit ng kalupitan para maiwasan ang kalupitan. Kung ang pansariling-pagtatanggol ay palaging mali, tsaka ito ay hindi pwedeng maging marahas "napinsala" sa isang magsasalakay. However, preferences that cannot be inflicted upon others fall into the APA or morally neutral category. To place the violence of self-defence into these categories is to say that violence cannot be inflicted on others – but the very nature of violence is that it *is* inflicted on others, and thus this approach results in a surfeit of contradictions.

Self-defence cannot be “evil,” since evil by definition can be prevented through force. However, self-defence is a response to the initiation of force, and thus cannot be prevented through force, any more than you can stop the motion of a soccer ball by kicking it violently.

Self-defence also cannot be *required* behaviour, since required behaviour (“don’t rape”) can be enforced through violence, which would mean that anyone failing to violently defend himself could be legitimately aggressed against. However, someone failing to defend himself is *already* being aggressed against, and so we end up in a circular situation where everyone can legitimately act violently against a person who is not defending himself, which is not only illogical, but morally abhorrent.

If Bob attacks Doug, but it is completely wrong for Doug to use violence to defend himself, then violence ends up being placed into two moral categories – the initiation of force is morally good, but self-defence is morally evil, which cannot stand according to UPB.

However, you might argue, does not the proposition that self-defence is good also make violence both good and bad at the same time – the violence that is used to attack is bad, but the violence that is used for self-defence is good?

This is an interesting objection – however, if the initiation of force is evil, then it can be prohibited by using force, since that is one of the very definitions of evil that we worked out above.

Thus it is impossible for any logical moral theory to reject the moral validity of self-defence.

### Child Raising

Instinctively, we generally understand that there is something quite wrong with parents who do not feed their babies. To conceive a child, carry a child to term, give birth to the child, and then leave it lying in its crib to starve to death, severely offends our sensibilities.

Of course, our offence is in no way a moral argument, but it is an excellent starting place to test a moral theory.

Before, when we were talking about UPB, we noted that, where there are exceptions in UPB, there must be objective differences in biology. Or, to put it more accurately, where there are objective differences in biology, there may be rational exceptions or differences in UPB. A child of five has a biologically immature brain and nervous system, and thus cannot rationally process the long-term consequences of his actions. It is the immature brain that is the key here, insofar as if an adult male is retarded to the point where his brain is the equivalent to that of a five year old, he would also have a reduced responsibility for his actions.

Thus when we point to situations of reduced responsibility, we are not *taking away* responsibility that exists, but rather recognising a situation where responsibility does not exist, at least to some degree. If I say that a man in a wheelchair cannot take the escalator, I am not taking away his right to take the escalator, but merely pointing out that he cannot, in fact, use it. When I say that UPB does not apply to the actions of a five year old, I am not saying that UPB is subjective, any more than a height requirement for a roller coaster somehow makes the concept of “tall” subjective.

If I voluntarily enter into a contract with you wherein I promise to pay your bills for a year, I have not signed myself into slavery, but I certainly have taken on a positive obligation that I am now responsible for.

If I run a nursing home, and I take in patients who are unable to feed themselves, then if I do not feed those patients, I am responsible for their resulting deaths. No one is *forcing* me to take in these patients, but once I have expressed a desire and a willingness to take care of them, then I am responsible for their continued well-being.

In the same way, if I borrow your lawnmower, I am obligated to bring it back in more or less the same state that it was when I borrowed it. Similarly, if I go to a pet store and buy a dog, I have taken on a voluntary obligation to take care of that dog. This does not mean that I am now the dog’s slave until the day it dies, but it does mean that as long as the dog is in my possession, I have a responsibility to try to keep it healthy.

These kinds of implicit contracts are quite common in life. We do not sign a contract with a restaurateur when we go to eat a meal in his restaurant; it is simply understood that we will pay before we leave. I have never signed a contract when I walk into a store promising not to shoplift, but they have the right to prosecute me if I do. I also have never signed a contract promising not to rape a woman if we go on a date, yet such a “contract” certainly exists, according to UPB.

If I run a nursing home, and disabled people rely on me to feed them, if I prove unable to feed them for some reason, then my responsibility is clearly to find somebody else who will feed them. The grave danger is not that *I* don’t feed them, but rather that everyone else thinks that I *am* feeding them, and so do not provide them food. This accords with an old moral argument about diving into a river to save someone from drowning. I am not obligated to dive into a river to save someone from drowning, but the moment that I do – or state my intention openly – then I am responsible for trying to save that person, for the very practical reason that everyone else thinks that I am going to save that person, and so may not take direct action themselves.

Thus it is assumed that parents will feed and take care of their newborn baby. If said parents decide against such care-giving, then they are obligated to give the child up to other people who *will* care for it, or face the charge of murder, just as the manager of a home for the disabled must either feed those who utterly depend on him, or give them up to someone who will. If I decide that I no longer want to take care of my dog, I must find him another home, not simply let him starve to death.

This all relies on the principle of third-party self-defence, which is fully supported by the framework of UPB, since the right of self-defence is universal. If I see a man in a wheelchair being attacked by a woman, I have the right to defend him – and this is all the more true if he lacks the capacity to defend himself.

Since children cannot feed themselves, earn a living or live independently, they are the moral equivalent of kidnap victims, or the wife we talked about before whose husband locked her in the basement. Children also lack the capacity for effective self-defence, due to their small stature and near-complete dependence upon their parents.

Thus since it is certainly the case that we have the right to act in self-defence for someone else – and that right becomes even stronger if that person cannot act in his own self-defence, it is perfectly valid to use force against parents who do not feed their children, just as it is perfectly valid to use force against the husband who is starving his wife to death by locking her in the basement.

As we also mentioned above, the less able a victim is to avoid the situation, the worse the crime is. Even the wife who ends up locked in the basement has at least *some* ownership in the matter, because she chose to marry this evil lunatic to begin with. Once she is locked in the basement, the situation is unavoidable, yet there were doubtless many clues hinting at her husband’s abusive nature, from the day she first met him.

Children, however, are the ultimate victims, because they never had any chance to avoid the situations they find themselves in. Thus we can logically establish the responsibility of parents towards their children by using the UPB framework. Since every person is responsible for the effects of his or her body, and children are an effect of the body, then parents are responsible for their children. Since everyone has the right to self-defence, for themselves and for others – since it is a universal right – then anyone can act to defend children. Since everyone must fulfil voluntary obligations, and having children is a voluntary obligation, parents must fulfil those obligations related to children. Since, through inaction, causing the death of someone completely dependent upon you is the equivalent of murder, parents are liable for such a crime.

We could of course put forward the proposition that parents do not have to take care of their children, but that is far too specific a principle to be a moral premise – it would be the same as saying “parents can murder,” which is not UPB-compliant, and so would require a biological differentiation to support an exception – and becoming a parent does not utterly overturn and reverse one’s biological nature.

Parents who starve a child to death are clearly guilty of murder. Children are born into this world in a state of involuntary imprisonment within the family – this does not mean that the family is evil, or corrupt – it is simply a statement of biological fact. Children are by the parents’ choice enslaved to the parents – this form of biological incarceration puts negligent parents in the same moral position as a kidnapper who allows his captive to starve to death, or a nurse who lets her utterly-dependent patients die of thirst.
