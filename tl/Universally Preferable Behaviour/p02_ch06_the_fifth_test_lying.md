## Ang Panlimang Pagsusulit: Pagsisinungaling

Ang tanong ng *pagsisinungaling* ay interesante dahil ang pagsasabi ng totoo ay pangkalahatang ikonokonsidera na unibersal na kanais-nais, ngunit hindi maipapatupad sa pamamagitan ng karahasan.

Sa pangkalahatan ay itinuring itong *mas* isang mahigpit na kinakailangan kaysa sa "pagiging nasa oras," ngunit *hindi masyadong* istrikto kaysa "pagnanakaw." Ano ang sinasabi ng balangkas ng UPB tungkol dito?

Sa likas na katangian, ang anumang teorya ng moral na nagmumungkahi na ang "pagsisinungaling ay mabuti" ay kaagad na sariling sasabog, dahil kung ang tao na nagmumungkahi nito *ay* nagsisinungaling – na kung saan ay mabuti – kung gayon ang pagsisinungaling ay masama, sapagkat sinabi sa kanya ang katotohanan na ang pagsisinungaling ay masama.

Halimbawa:

**Bob:** Ang pagsisinungaling ay laging mabuti.

**Doug:** Nagsisinungaling ka ba?

**Bob:** Oo.

**Doug:** Kaya ang pagsisinungaling ay dapat na masama, dahil ikaw ay nagsisinungaling tungkol sa pagiging mabuti nito.

O:

**Bob:** Ang pagsisinungaling ay laging mabuti.

**Doug:** Nagsisinungaling ka ba?

**Bob:** Hindi.

**Doug:** Kung gayon ang pagsisinungaling ay hindi laging mabuti, yamang sinasabi mo ang katotohanan tungkol sa pagiging mabuti ng pagsisinungaling.

Lying, however, does not require the initiation of force, and so does not violate the possibility of *avoidability*. Since liars can be avoided, they cannot logically be aggressed against.

Lying also fits more closely in the category of *violence*, insofar as it is moral to lie in self-defence, just as it is moral to use violence in self-defence It is hard to think of a situation where one would have to “be late” in self-defence, or “be rude.” However, if a man bursts into your house and demands to know where your beloved wife is so he can slap her around, it would seem a parody of integrity to refuse to lie to him. Lying in this case would be a form of third-party self-defence, and as morally acceptable as the use of violence in self-defence Similarly, if a man obtains a hundred dollars from us by lying, we may justly lie to him to get it back.

Thus we may justly lie to a liar, just as we may justly defend ourselves from a punch with a punch, but we would not exactly respect the escalating pettiness of “repaying” a tardy person by showing up even later.

The difference is that “being late” is not as actively destructive as lying. A tardy person is annoying, but does not fundamentally undermine your capacity to process reality. It’s one thing for me to show up an hour late for a meeting at seven o’clock in the morning – it’s quite another to attempt to convince you that we in fact scheduled the meeting for eight o’clock in the morning, when I know that this was not the case.

Attacking your confidence in your own mind[^5] is far more egregious than merely making you wait, since it is the act of using another’s trust in you to undermine his trust in himself, which is highly corrupt, since it is *using* a value to undermine a value, like counterfeiting. This is how UPB validates the illogic of the proposition “lying is good,” and confirms that the act of lying to someone is worse than “being late,” but better than “assault.”
