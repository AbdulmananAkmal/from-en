## Introduksyon

Para sa hindi mabilang na mga henerasyon, ang sangkatauhan ay nanirahan sa isang uri ng egosentrikong sinapupunan ng sarili na ipinagkakait na kamangmangan: ang mundo ay patag, ang araw, ang buwan at ang mga bituin ay umiikot sa paligid niya, ang mga ninuno ay nakikilala sa kanya mula sa kabila ng mga ulap ng kamatayan, at ang kulog ay ang galit ng ang mga Diyos.

Ang pagkalugmok mula sa nakapagsasawa na sinapupunan ng isang pansariling interpretasyon ay nangangailangan ng paggawa ng millennia - at nagkakahalaga ng milyun-milyong buhay. Ang pagsisikap na kinakailangan upang pihitin ang aming pananaw mula sa *perceptual na karanasan* sa *haka-haka na lohika* ay sumisindak, magalak, lubos na nakakataranta at lubhang mapanganib. Ang pag-unawa na ang mundo ay hindi tulad ng *tulad ng*, o *tila tulad ng*, ay - at nananatiling - ang pinakadakilang gawa ng aming katalinuhan. Ang katotohanan ng katotohanan ay naging sa mga mata ng pag-iisip, hindi sa laman.

Mukhang patag ang mundo; hindi ito. Ang araw at ang buwan ay mukhang pareho ang laki; hindi sila. Ang mga bituin ay mukhang lumilibot sa lupa; hindi nila. Ang pag-aaral ng katotohanan ay nangangailangan na makikita natin ang mundo mula sa labas ng ating mga pandama - hindi ito nangangahulugan ng pagtanggi sa ating mga pandama, kundi isang pagsisiyasat ng hangin sa *tunay* katibayan ng mga pandama, na hindi na ang mundo ay patag, ngunit , ang mga batas sa enerhiya at pisikal ay pare-pareho. Kapag hinayaan natin ang bato sa ating kamay, ito ay bumagsak - ito ang tunay na katibayan ng mga pandama, hindi na ang Mundo ay maayos at hindi matitinag. Ang paliwanag na ang mundo ay hindi kumikilos ay isang maling palagay na nagkakasalungatan sa direktang katibayan ng ating mga pandama, na ang lahat ay bumagsak. Kung ang lahat ay bumagsak, ang mundo ay hindi maayos at hindi matitinag.

Ito ang mga maliit na katotohanan sa araw-araw; na ang mga bato ay bumabagsak, ang usok ay tumataas, ang apoy ay mainit at ang araw at ang buwan ay parehong umiikot. Kung mananatili tayong matatag at mahigpit na nakatuon sa mga "maliliit na katotohanan," maaari nating makuha ang mga dakilang katotohanan ng pisika, na nagbibigay sa atin ng kahanga-hangang kaalaman at kapangyarihan.

Gayunman, sa pagitan ng mga maliit na katotohanan at ang mga dakilang katotohanan, ang mga ilusyon na bulag sa amin - parehong sa pisika at sa etika.

Sa pisika, ang mga dakilang katotohanan ay hindi maaaring sumalungat sa maliliit na katotohanan. Walang "Ang pinag-isang patlang ng teorya" ang maaaring wasto na sumasalungat sa aming direktang diwa-karanasan ng bumabagsak na bato o umaangat na apoy. Ang pinakadakilang teorya ng matematika ay hindi maaaring balido kung ang paglalapat nito ay nagbabalik ng maling pagbabago sa checkout kawnter.

Sa kasaysayan, gayunpaman, sa pagitan ng aming sariling mga maliit na katotohanan at ang mga dakilang katotohanan ay namamalagi kung ano ang tatawagan ko sa "null zone."

### Ang "Null Zone"

Sinasabi namin sa aming mga anak na huwag suntukin ang isa't isa, at naniniwala kami na ang karahasan ay mali sa abstract, bilang isang pangkalahatang moral na tuntunin. Ang "maliit na katotohanan" ay: *Huwag manuntok*. Ang "dakilang katotohanan" ay: *Ang karahasan ay mali*.

Gayunpaman, may nasa isip ang isang haka-haka na nilalang na tinatawag na "Diyos," at ang nilalang na ito ay itinuturing na lubos na moral. Sa kasamaang palad, ang entidad na ito ay patuloy at labis na lumalabag sa utos na "ang karahasan ay mali" sa pamamagitan ng pagkalunod sa mundo, paglalagay ng mga kaluluwa sa impiyerno sa kabila ng isang perpektong kaalaman sa kaalaman ng kanilang "mga desisyon," sanctioning panggagahasa, pagpatay, pagnanakaw, atake at iba pang mga pagkilos na ipaparusa bilang masama sa anumang indibidwal.

Sa gayon ay mayroon tayong maliit na katotohanan (*huwag sumuntok*) at ang dakilang katotohanan (*ang karahasan ay mali*) ngunit sa gitna, mayroon kaming "null zone" * kung saan ang kumpletong kabaligtaran ng parehong maliit na katotohanan at ang aming mahusay Ang mga katotohanan ay itinuturing na ganap na totoo *.

Sa kasaysayan, maaari naming makita ang hindi pagkakapare-pareho sa pisika. Walang perpektong mga bilog sa aming direktang karanasan, ngunit dahil sa isang paniniwala sa Diyos, ang lahat ng paggalaw ng planeta ay dapat na isang "perpektong bilog" - isang saligan na tumagal ng astronomiya sa loob ng maraming siglo. Sa katulad na paraan, kung ang isang tao ay lumiliko, hindi siya makatwirang naniniwala na ang buong mundo ay umiikot sa kanya - at maligaya niyang ilagay ito bilang hindi lamang ng kanyang sariling "maliit na katotohanan," ngunit bilang isang mahusay na katotohanan, o unibersal na prinsipyo . Ngunit sa karamihan ng kasaysayan ng tao, pinaniniwalaan na ang mga bituin at mga planeta ay pinaikot sa paligid ng Mundo, sa halip na ang Mundo ay pinaikot. Dito muli maaari naming makita ang "null zone" sa pagitan ng direktang karanasan sa pakiramdam at unibersal na prinsipyo, kung saan ganap na kabaligtaran ng prinsipyo ay itinuturing na ganap na wasto.

Walang nakakaunawa sa tao ang Diyos nang direkta. Sa kanyang pang-araw-araw na buhay, ganap na tinatanggap niya na *na hindi maaaring makita ay hindi umiiral*. Walang makatuwirang tao ang bumubulusok tuwing may hakbang siya, na natatakot ang isang di-nakikitang pader na maaaring hadlangan ang kanyang paraan. Ang pinakadakilang abstraksiyon ng agham ay sumusuporta sa kanyang diskarte.

Sa kabaligtaran, sa "null zone" ng relihiyon, ang eksaktong kabaligtaran ng parehong maliit na katotohanan at ang mga dakilang katotohanan ay pinaniniwalaan na totoo. Sa personal, ang isang tao ay naniniwala na *na kung saan ay hindi maaaring paghinalaan ay hindi umiiral* - intellectually, agham ay napatunayan na ito nang paulit-ulit. Gayunpaman, sa "null zone" ng teolohiya, ang eksaktong kabaligtaran na panukala ay totoo - ang aksiyum ay may *na hindi maaaring makita *ay dapat na umiiral*.

Ang aming paniniwala sa kabutihan ng militar ay namamalagi rin sa "null zone." Kung ang isang pribadong tao ay binabayaran sa pagpatay ng ibang lalaki, tinawag namin siyang isang "baril para sa pag-upa," at hinahatulan siya bilang isang hit na tao. Kung, gayunpaman, ang taong ito ay naglalagay ng berdeng kasuutan na may ilang mga ribbons *at gumawa ng parehong pagkilos*, tinatanggap namin siya bilang isang bayani at ginagantimpalaan siya ng pensiyon. Ang maliit na katotohanan (*hindi ko dapat patayin*) ay perpektong kaayon ng dakilang katotohanan (*ang pagpatay ay mali*) - gayon pa man sa gitna ay may isang "null zone," kung saan ang pagpatay ay mahiwaga na nagiging "banal."

Kung ang "null zone" na ito ay may-bisa, walang makatuwirang lohikal na panukala. Kung ang isang panukala ay totoo - at ang eksaktong kabaligtaran ng panukalang iyon ay totoo rin - kung gayon ang lohikal na pangangatwiran ay nagiging imposible. Ang paglago ng nakapangangatwiran na agham ay naging matatag na pag-atake sa "null zone na ito," at ang paglusob ng layunin na pagkakapare-pareho sa mga maliliit na mga bulsa na ito ng pansarili na kapritso.

Sa mga lumang mapa, bago maganap ang mga kartograpo sa kanilang mga pagtuklas, ang mga drowing ng mga kilalang lupain ay lilipas sa blangkong papel. Ang paglago ng kaalaman ay nangangailangan ng una sa isang delineation ng kung ano ang hindi kilala, at pagkatapos ay isang pagpapalawak ng mga kilalang mga prinsipyo sa mga hindi kilalang lugar.

Totoong pareho rin ito sa larangan ng moralidad.

### The Casualties

Crossing this “null zone” is fraught with peril. The road from the little truths to the great truths is paved with the bones of millions. From the death of Socrates to the torture of early scientists by religious zealots, to the millions who have murdered and died for the black fantasies of fascism and communism, any forward-thrust of human knowledge into the “null zone” is fraught with considerable danger.

Must “crossing the null zone” – or seamlessly uniting the little truths with the great truths – inevitably be so difficult and dangerous? It is an enormous challenge to unite the perceptual with the conceptual in a straight line of logical reasoning – but *must* this progress take thousands of years and oceans of blood?

If we look at the technological and economic progress of mankind, we see more or less a flat line for countless millennia, followed by massive and asymptotic spikes over the past few hundred years. It is inconceivable that some widespread genetic mutation could account for this sudden and enormous acceleration of intellectual consistency and material success. Theories claiming that a certain “snowball effect” came into existence, mysteriously propelled by an accumulation of all the little increments of knowledge that had occurred since the dawn of civilisation, can usually be dismissed out of hand as entirely *ex post facto* explanations, since they have no predictive value.

If we understand that our staggering potential has been available to us for at least tens of thousands of years – and that there is both great profit and great pleasure in exercising it – then it at once becomes clear that we really *do* want to use our amazing minds.

Thus there must be a downward force that has historically acted to crush and enslave the natural liberty of mankind.

In the realm of science, it is not too hard to see the oppressive forces that continually kept our minds in near-primeval ignorance. The combination of superstition in the form of religion, and violence in the form of the aristocracy, threatened rational thinkers with intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and murder. Just as a farmer profits from the low intelligence of his cows, and a slave-owner profits from the fear of his slaves, priests and kings retained their privileges by threatening with death anyone who dared to think.

The simple truth is that “priests” and “kings” were – and are – merely men. The simple truth is that the gods and devils that were supposed to justify their rule never existed.

We have made great strides in understanding the nature and reality of simple human equality, but the sad fact of the matter is that the realm of *morality* is still lost in the “null zone” – in the destructive illusions of the “middle truths.”

### "Middle Truths"

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

These “middle truths” are the most dangerous illusions of all, because they grant the *appearance* of truth while actually *attacking* the truth.

By providing the illusion that we have found the truth, “middle truths” actually prevent us from gaining the truth. They are the last line of defence for fantasy, predation and exploitation.

Since they are not only irrational, but *anti*-rational, “middle truths” remain endlessly flexible – as long as they serve those in power. For instance, Christianity arose out of the growing fascism of the late Roman Empire partly by lashing out at the “primitive” superstitions of existing theologies. “Forget your old gods, we have a brand new God who is far better!”

“Middle truths” always take the form of a truth, followed by a lie. “Zeus is a pagan superstition” is a true statement, which was openly made by Christian proselytisers. The lie that followed was: “Yahweh is not a pagan superstition, but a real and living God.”

We can personalise this a little bit more with an example that will be familiar to anyone who has ever counselled a dysfunctional friend. “My last boyfriend was a real jerk,” she will say, and you will fervently agree. “My new boyfriend is really *great* though,” she will add, and you will try not to roll your eyes.

It is very hard not to replace one illusion with another.

“The British government is a tyranny!” cried the American revolutionaries in the eighteenth century – and, after evicting the British troops, they then set up their own government and started attacking their own citizens.

“Aristocracy is an unjust abomination!” cried other revolutionaries, who then set up the tyranny of the majority in the form of democracy.

“Middle truths” can also exist in science, and similarly prevent the natural progress from the little truths to the great truths. Until the eighteenth century, for instance, biologists believed in “spontaneous generation,” or the idea that life can spring from nonliving matter. This had never been observed, of course, but conformed to ancient writings both philosophical and religious, and so was accepted as fact. Also, prior to the Einsteinian revolution in 1905, light was believed to move through a fixed and invisible substance called “luminiferous ether,” just as sound waves move through air. No scientist who believed in this theory had any empirical evidence for this “ether,” either personally or scientifically – but it was considered necessary to conform to other observable characteristics.

Religion is also another “middle truth” – one of the most dangerous ones. It is true that we are a unique species in the universe, as far as we know. A giraffe is a taller quadruped, but man is not just a “smarter” primate, but something quite different. The nature of that difference remains largely unknown – the religious explanation of “we are not the same as animals because we have a soul and were created by a God” is just another example of a “middle truth.” It is true that we are very different from animals. It is not true that we were created by a god and have a soul.

Just as some parasites cannot take root until they dislodge the prior parasites, “middle truths” only attack previous illusions *so that they can take their place*. Those who are sceptical of the prior fantasies are drawn towards the new fantasy. Thus does Christianity displace paganism, Marxism displace Christianity, post-modernism displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy, and so on.

Until the great truths are achieved, and united with the little truths, “middle truths” are just a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods – specifically designed to prevent the achievement of the great truths.

And the great truths are always achieved from the little truths.

The world falls because a rock falls.

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

Biologically, parasitism is a wholly viable survival strategy for many creatures. In the absence of ethical norms, stealing energy and resources from other creatures is perfectly sensible. In general, the most sustainable and stable form of parasitism is *symbiosis*, or mutually beneficial coexistence. Thus the bacteria that inhabit our intestines aid their own survival by helping us digest our food.

However, a virus that renders us continually exhausted, and barely able to keep ourselves alive, can scarcely be called “mutually beneficial.” If we think of our long and grim history of disaster, starvation, war, disease and poverty – and compare it with the astounding material successes of modernity – it is clear that a form of parasitism tyrannised our minds and capacities for millennia. Now that the last few hundred years have shown the power and creativity of the human spirit, we can view our species as an organism that has shaken off a terrible parasite, and sprung from an endless gasping deathbed to perform the most astounding feats of gymnastics.

When we cure ourselves of a disease, we feel better, but the disease does not. From the perspective of the smallpox virus, the smallpox vaccine is genocidal.

In the same way, the parasites that strangle mankind view the liberty of the majority with horror. Since their parasitism frees them from the demands of reality – to earn their daily bread – they inevitably view the freedom of the masses as a form of enslavement for themselves. Thus would a farmer view the “liberation” of his livestock as an utter disaster…

Establishing truth necessarily limits fantasy. Limiting fantasy necessarily limits exploitation. If I can convince you that I am a living man-God, and that the God who birthed me wants you to give me ten percent of your income, or you will be punished for eternity, then I can become exceedingly rich. I am a parasite of illusions, and depend on those illusions for my sustenance as surely as fungus relies on warmth, dampness – and darkness.

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you.

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

However, when a government agent sends you a letter demanding that you pay him money, you may feel a certain indignity, but you would not relate the story with the same horror and indignation to your friends.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
