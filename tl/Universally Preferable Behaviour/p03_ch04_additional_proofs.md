## Mga Karagdagang Katunayan

Mayroong iba pang mga karagdagang patunay na maaari naming dalhin upang madala sa tanong ng higit sa lahat mas mabuting pag-uugali.

### Ang Libreng-Merkado ng Ekonomiya

Ang isang libreng-merkado ng ekonomiya ay walang alinlangan ang pinaka mahusay at paraan ng paggawa ng yaman ng pag-aayos ng produksyon at paggamit ng mga kalakal at mga mapagkukunan sa loob ng lipunan. Ang materyal na tagumpay nito ay walang katumbas sa kasaysayan ng tao, o sa buong mundo.

Inaasahan ng balangkas ng UPB, nagpapatunay at nagpapaliwanag ng mga dahilan para sa mga materyal na tagumpay ng isang libreng ekonomiya sa merkado.

Sa teorya, ang malayang pamilihan ay base sa aplikasyon ng unibersal na teorya ng karapatan sa ari-arian. Sa kabilang dako, ang komunismo ay base sa malinaw na pagtanggi ng unibersal na teorya ng karapatan sa ari-arian. Dahil napatunayan na natin sa itaas na ang unibersal na karapatan sa ari-arian ay ang tanging balidong teoryang moral, ito ay nagpapaliwanag sa pinakamahalagang antas kung bakit ang komunismo ay isang sakuna, habang ang ekonomiya ng malayang pamilihan ay produktibo sa materyal.

Since human beings *do in fact* have equal rights of property, any social system which rejects this right is doomed to utter failure – just as any bridge planner who rejects the reality of gravity will never be able to build a bridge that stands.

### The Scientific Method

Logic and science are in fact methodologies which exist – along with morality – under the umbrella of UPB. In other words, logic and science are both validated by the framework of UPB.

A central question which needs to be answered is: *why is the scientific method infinitely superior to other “methodologies” of knowledge acquisition, such as mysticism?*

UPB answers this question.

Since any methodology for knowledge acquisition must be universal, consistent, and independent of time and place, the scientific method meets these requirements, while irrational and subjective mysticism is the exact opposite of these requirements.

### Public Education

One central principle of free market economics is that quality only really results from *voluntarism*. Coercion, fundamentally, is inefficient – violence always results in poor quality. The old-style Soviet bakeries never carried good bread; a man who beats his wife will never have a happy marriage.

The initiation of the use of force is always counter to any rational moral theory – it is a specific and explicit violation of UPB. Since public schools are funded through the initiation of the use of force, they are a form of *forced association*, which is a clear violation of the *freedom of association* validated by UPB.

Since force violates the moral requirement of *avoidability* – and a lack of avoidability always breeds poor quality – UPB would help us easily predict that public schools would provide education of low quality.

Furthermore, UPB would also have helped us predict that, as more and more force was used in the realm of public education – as taxes, union compulsions and so on escalated – the quality of the education provided would get worse and worse.

This, of course, was – and is – exactly the case.
