## Ang Ikalawang Pagsususri: Sa Pagpatay

Ating subukan ngayon ang balangkas ng UPB laban sa mga layuning moral tungkol sa *pagpatay* na dito ay tinukoy bilang ang pagpatay ay sinadya at may pangunahing hindi sa pagtatanggol sa sarili.

Sapagkat ginugol namin ang labis na oras na pinagtatalunan ang tanong ng panghahalay – at dahil marami sa mga magkaparehong argumento ay nalalapat dito - ang pagtatasa na ito ay pwedeng maging mas maikli.

Bumalik tayo sa aming dalawang moral guinea pig na nakaupo sa isang silid - tatawagan namin silang dalawa si Bob at Doug.

Kung ang pagpatay ay mabuti sa moral, pagkatapos ay malinaw *pigilan ang sarili* mula sa pagpatay sa imoral. Kaya ang tanging pagkakataon na kailangang maging moral sina Bob at Doug ay kaagad na pinapatay nila ang isa't isa. Sa pisikal na paraan, ito ay napaka-imposible ito na kurso - kung pareho silang tumayo at mahigpit na panggigipit ng bawat isa, hindi sila kailanman makakalusot sa pagsabog nang eksakto sa parehong sandali. Kung si Bob ay unang namatay, ang kanyang mahigpit na pagkakahawak sa lalamunan ni Doug ay maluwag, kaya hinahatulan si Doug sa kalagayan ng *imoralidad* hanggang sa oras na makahanap siya ng bago na namang biktima. Sapagkat ang unang namatay ay si Bob – at sa gayon ay hindi maaaring patuloy na subukan pagpatay Doug – Ang kamatayan ni Bob ay nagbigay sa kanya ng mas imoral kaysa sa pagpatay ni Doug.

Intindihin ang sarili, lubos nating kinikilala ang kabaliwan ng moral na panukala na ang pagpatay ay mabuti. Lohikal, alam namin na ang panukala ay hindi tama dahil kung ito ay totoo, imposible para sa dalawang lalaki sa isang silid na kapwa ang maging moral sa parehong oras. Lohikal, alam namin na ang panukala ay hindi tama dahil kung ito ay totoo, imposible para sa dalawang lalaki sa isang silid na kapwa maging moral sa makaparehong oras. The UPB framework confirms that Bob cannot be “evil” *while* he is strangling Doug, and then achieve the pinnacle of moral virtue the moment that he kills Doug – and then revert immediately back to a state of evil. Moral propositions must be universal, and independent of time and place. The proposition that murder is moral fails this requirement at every level, and so is not valid.

If murder were morally good, then it would also be the case that a man stranded on a desert island would be morally evil for as long as he lived there, since he would have no victims to kill. A man in a coma would also be evil, as would a sleeping man, or a man on the operating table. A torturer would be an evil man as long as he continued to torture – but then would become a good man in the moment that his victim died at his hand.

We can thus see that the proposition that “murder is good” is not only instinctively bizarre, but also logically impossible.

The other objections that applied to the proposition “rape is good” also apply here. Murder cannot be morally neutral, since morally neutral judgements or actions cannot be forcibly inflicted upon another, and murder by definition is forcibly inflicted upon another.

There is also a basic contradiction involved in any universal justification for the act of murder, just as there was in the act of rape. If Bob tries to strangle Doug, but Doug resists, how could Bob rationally justify his actions according to UPB?

Well, he could say something like: “a man’s life can be taken any time you want to” – but of course, since UPB is the only valid test of moral propositions, this justifies Doug killing Bob as much as it does Bob killing Doug. Thus Bob can only justify strangling Doug if Doug does not resist in any way – but of course if Doug does not resist, then can it really be considered murder?

Let us say that Bob then adjusts his premise to say: “I can shoot a man in his sleep any time I want.” The problem here is not only the sleep that Bob will lose based on his universal premise, but also the logical impossibility of reversing moral propositions based on the differences in the states of sleeping and waking. Biologically speaking, a man does not become the *opposite* of a man when he falls asleep, any more than gravity reverses when he blinks.

Since a man remains a man when he falls asleep, it cannot be the case that opposite moral rules apply to him in this state. Thus to say that it is immoral to murder a man when he is awake, but it is moral to murder a him when he is asleep, is to create a logical contradiction unsupported by any objective biological facts. A physicist may say that a rock falls down, but a helium balloon rises up – but that is because a rock and a helium balloon have fundamentally different properties. No credible physicist can say that one rock falls down, but that another rock with almost exactly the same qualities falls up. The same is true for moral theories – no credible philosopher can say that morality reverses itself when a man is asleep, since a man’s nature does not fundamentally alter when he naps.

In this way, if we cannot justly shoot a man when he is awake, we also cannot shoot him when he is asleep, since he is still a man.

Thus, since the statement “I can shoot a man in his sleep any time I want” cannot be validated according to UPB, it cannot be a true moral proposition.

Here again we find that the UPB framework holds true in terms of murder. The only possible valid moral theory regarding murder is that it is evil, or universally banned.

We could take the same approach to the question of assault, but the arguments would be identical to those of rape and murder, so for the sake of brevity, we shall continue.

Let us now turn to the question of theft. If this framework holds true here as well, then we have hit the perfect trifecta of our instinctual moral understanding, and found rational confirmation for our existing beliefs. We have discovered the maths that explains how we are able to instinctively catch a ball, and that is a necessary start.

### Self-Defence?

We have skirted over the issue of self-defence with regards to murder, though it is scarcely necessary to examine it in the case of rape. This is not because the issue of self-defence is either self-evident or uncomplicated, but rather because the complications that exist can be dealt with more comprehensively after we look at the question of theft.
