# Ang mga konklusyon

Sa isang maikling panahon, nasasaklawan natin ang pinakamalaking bilang ng nasasakupang lupa. Ang pinakamatinding hamon ng pilosopiya ay ang kahulugan ng isang unibersal, hangarin o ganap na moralidad na hindi umaasa sa Diyos o sa estado. Ang bawat sandali na umaasa tayo sa Diyos o sa estado para sa kahulugan ng moralidad, ang moralidad ay hindi na mananatiling unibersal, layunin at lubos. Sa madaling salita, ito ay walang "moralidad"

Ang pag-imbento ng mga nasa-isip na nilalang tulad ng "Diyos" at "ang estado" ay ginagawa *wala*upang masagot ang aming mga tanong tungkol sa moralidad.

Nalaman nating lubos na ang nilikha ng Diyos ay walang ginawa - at walang gagawin - upang sagutin ang mga tanong tungkol sa pinagmulan ng buhay, o sa sang katauhan. Upang masabi, bilang sagot sa alinmang tanong, "ang hindi maunawaan na ginawa ng ilang hindi maiisip na bagay sa di-matukoy na layunin," ay hindi maituturing na anumang uri ng makatwirang sagot.

Ang pinakamatinding panganib sa paggawa ng hindi maunawaan na "mga sagot" sa makatuwiran at mahahalagang mga tanong ay binibigay ng *ilusyon* ng isang sagot, sa pangkalahatan ay magkaila sa pagtugis ng katotohanan. Higit pa rito, ang isang samahan ay pweding magkaisa upang magtanggol at kumita mula sa hindi makatwiran na di-sagot na ito. Sa larangan ng relihiyon, ito ang tahanan ng mga pari. Sa larangan ng pamahalaan, ito ang pampulitika caste.

Kung paano ang isang tunay at mahalaga na tanong ay nasasagot ng isang mystical at marahas na "sagot," ang pag-unlad ng tao ay lumilihis sa pagbabalik. Ang agham ng meteorolohiya ay nabigo at kung ang mga pari ay nagsasabi na ang ulan ay dahil kalooban ito ng Diyos. Ang agham ng medisina ay hindi nabuo at kung ang sakit ay itinuturing na isang parusang moral mula sa diyos. Ang agham ng puwesto ng pisika at bumalik kung ang paggalaw ng mga bituin ay itinuturing na ang orasan ng mga bathala.

Kapag ang mga mali na sagot na iniharap sa mga moral na tanong, ang pagtatanong sa mga sagot ay hindi pweding maging isang moral na krimen. Kapag ang mga ilusyon ay pinalitan para sa pag alinlangan, ang mga taong kumikita mula sa mga ilusyon ay hindi pweding hindi matapos gamit ang karahasan upang ipagtanggol ang kanilang mga kasinungalingan.

And for evermore, *children* are the first victims of these exploitive falsehoods.

Children do not have to be bullied into eating candy, playing tag, or understanding that two plus two is four. The human mind does not require that the truth be inflicted through terror, boredom, insults and repetition. A child does not have to be “taught” that a toy is real by telling him that he is damned to hell for eternity if he does not *believe* that the toy is real. A child does not have to be bullied into believing that chocolate tastes good by being told that his taste buds are damned by original sin.

Saying that morality exists because God tells us that it exists is exactly the same as saying that morality does not exist. If you buy an iPod from me on eBay, and I send you an empty box, you will write to me in outrage. If I tell you not to worry, that my invisible friend assures me that there is in fact an iPod in the box, would you be satisfied? Would not my claim that my invisible friend tells me of the iPod’s existence be a certain proof that the iPod did not in fact exist?

If morality is justified according to the authority of a being that does not exist, then morality by definition is not justified. If I write a check that is “certified” by a bank that does not exist, then clearly my check is by definition *invalid*.

The same is true for enforcing morality through the irrational monopoly of “the state.” If we allow the existence of a government – a minority of people who claim the right to initiate the use of force, a right which is specifically denied to everyone else – then any and all moral “rules” enforced by the government are purely subjective, since the government is *by definition* based on a violation of moral rules.

If I say that I need the government to protect my property, but that the government is by definition a group of people who can violate my property rights at will, then I am caught in an insurmountable contradiction. I am saying that my property rights must be defended – and then I create an agency to defend them that can violate them at any time. This is like being so afraid of rape that I hire a bodyguard to protect me from being raped – but in the contract, I allow my bodyguard – and anyone he chooses – to rape me at will.

Because “morality” based on the state and on religion is so irrational and self-contradictory, it *requires* a social agency with a monopoly on the initiation of force to function. Since everyone is just making up “morals” and claiming absolute justification based on imaginary entities, rational negotiation and understanding remain impossible. We do not need a government because people are bad, but rather, because people are irrational, we end up with a government. False moral theories always end up requiring violence to enforce them. Moral theories are not developed in *response* to violence – false moral theories *cause* violence – in fact, *demand* violence.

The moral subjectivism and irrationality involved in answering “What is truth?” with “God,” and “What is morality?” with “government,” is so openly revealed by the framework of UPB that it is hard to imagine that this concept is not more widespread.

One central reason for this is that truly understanding UPB requires the very highest possible mental functioning. It is relatively easy to be rational; it is very difficult to think about the implicit premises of rationality, and all that they entail. It is relatively easy to debate; it is very difficult to tease out all of the implicit assumptions involved in the very act of debating.

It is easy to catch a ball – it is hard to invent the physics that explain motion *universally*.

Thinking *about* thinking is the hardest mental discipline of all.

At the beginning of this book, I talked about a “beast” that terrified and enslaved mankind. This beast is always located on a mountaintop, or in a deep cave. People are afraid of the beast in the world, which is why the beast has never been defeated.

The beast has never been defeated because the beast is an illusion.

The beast cannot be defeated in the world, because the beast is within ourselves.

The collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone,” where morality magically reverses itself, called “the government” is exactly the same as the collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone” called “God” where *reality* reverses itself.

If we define “morality” according to the subjective fantasies of mere mortals, then it will forever remain under the manipulative control of power-hungry tyrants. Since God does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to God is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Since “the state” does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to government is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Until we can define an objective and rational morality that is free from the subjective whims of each individual, we will never make the kind of progress that we need to as a species.

Morality, like physics, biology, geology and chemistry, must join the realm of the sciences if we are to flourish – and indeed, perhaps, to survive at all.

However, if we can sustain our courage, it is this discipline alone that can set us, and our children – and all humanity in the future – free from the tyranny of the greatest beast: our own moral illusions.
