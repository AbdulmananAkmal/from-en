## Parallel

Bago ang pag-agham rebolusyon, Ito ay isinasaalang-alang na hindi iisipin na ang nasabing likas na daigdig ay pwedeng umalalay mismo ng walang kaalaman at "moral" entity sa sentro nito. Ang araw at rosas ay sumusunod sa mga tanikala ng isang karaniwan na kalesa; ang buwan ay isang malamig at nag issang kapatid ng araw. Ang mga konstelasyon ay nakabalangkas at mga salaysay tungkol sa libingan ng mga diyos, at ang mga unos ay nagmula sa galit ng mga diyablo.

Ang mga ideya na ang kalikasan ay isang sariling-likha at sarili-nag tutukod ng sistema ay halos hindi mailarawan ng isip. Ang rebolusyon, ni Darwin, na ang iniisip na ang buhay ay hindi nilikha, pero sa halip ay nagbabago, dinala ito ng isip galing sa materyal para sa biolohikal na sangkataohan.

Sa harap ng siyensiya, sa sentro ng bawat mahihirap unawain ang sistema ng paraang itatatag ng isang banal na kamalayan - wala na ang kung saang sistemang ito ay mapunta sa malaking gulo, at pagtigil na.

Sa kasamaang palad, itong "mabait na kamalayan"ay isa lamang maling akala, para mailagay ito sa pinaka-mapagkawanggawa. Walang umiiral na mga diyos na ganoon-lahat ng iyon ay *gumawa* mayroon ding mga proklamasyon ang mga saserdote. Kaya naman kung ano ang talagang nakalagay sa sentro ay ang mga pagkiling ng di-makatuwirang tao, na sinoman ay ang walang alam kung gaano magalit silang talaga.

Lahat ay mayron upang isalin itong liwanag sa ating mga pagkakaintindi sa panglipunan -subalit ngayon ito ay *mahalagang* ginagawa natin.

Isinasaalang-alang ng lahat itong mahahalaga, at sa sentro ng panglipunan, lahat ng lugar ay banal na entidad tinatawag na äng pamahalaan." ay ang kawalan ng entidad, isinasaalang-alang ng lahat itong malinaw na ang lipunan ay mapadpad sa ganap na kaguluhan, at mailagay ito sa maging-makatwiran bilang mga aninong itinuturing, na nasa pagliban ng mga diyos, ang daigdig mismo ay papatungo sa malaking gulo, at ipatigil na.

Ganun paman, "ang gobyerno"wala nang umiiral kaysa "diyos"ang umiral.

Kapag tayo ay nagsasalaysay na patungkol sa "diyo,"ang ating talagang pinag-uusapan "ang opinyon ng mga pari."

Kung saan ang lahat ng mga pinag-uusapan na patungkol sa"ang pamahalaan,"lahat ay *tunay* na nangangahulugang "ang karahasan ay isang napaka liit na pagkakulang sa idad."

The idea of “spontaneous order,” which is well proven in the realms of physics and biology, remains largely inconceivable to us in the realm of society.

However, “governments” are no more needed for the organisation and continuance of society than “gods” are required for the organisation and continuance of the universe.

In fact, just as religions impeded the progress of science, so do governments impede the progress of society. Just as the illusions of *religion* caused the deaths of hundreds of millions of people throughout history, so have the illusions of *government*.

Just as the false ethics of religions “justify” all manners of abuse, corruption and violence, so do the false ethics of governments. When we choose to live by fantasy, we inevitably choose destruction, in one form or another.

When we choose to run society according to religious moral mythologies, we end up with wars, violence, repression, abuse, corruption and bottomless hypocrisy.

When we choose to run society according to *statist* moral mythologies, the results are no different.

We can either choose virtue or compulsion.

We cannot have both.

### Solutions

We can choose to believe that the government is both a necessary and a moral institution. We can choose to believe that, without government, society will collapse into “anarchy,” and the world will dissolve into a war of all against all. We can choose to believe that without the government, there will be no roads, no education, no healthcare, no old-age pensions, no libraries, no protection of property and so on.

Similar superstitions, of course, have retarded the progress of mankind throughout history. The most significant precursor to what UPB reveals about the government is what science revealed about religion.

As science began to practically postulate a universe that could run without a god, all manner of hysterics clamoured that the end of the world was nigh, that society would collapse into “anarchy,” and that civilisation would dissolve into a war of all against all.

Any time a system that justifies power can be conceived of running *without* that power, all those who profit from the manipulation of that power cry out that without them, all is lost.

Priests did this during the onset of the scientific revolution. Without God, life has no meaning. Without God, man has no morality. Without God, our souls cannot be saved. Without God, the world will descend into chaos and evil.

None of it turned out to be true, of course. In fact, quite the *reverse* turned out to be true. The end of religion as the dominant world-view paved the way for the separation of church and state, the end of the aristocracy, the rise of the free market, the establishment of many human liberties in significant areas of the world.

The fall of God was the rise of mankind.

In the same way, when we begin see society as the early scientists saw the universe – as a self-sustaining system without the need for an imaginary central authority – then we can truly begin to perceive the possibilities of freedom for mankind.

The establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in society perpetually retards the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, of virtue, of physical and mental health – just as the establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in the *universe* perpetually retarded the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, and science.

The way to oppose imaginary entities is with relentless truth. The way to oppose God is with reason, evidence and science.

The way to oppose the state – the most dangerous imaginary entity – is with reason, evidence and science.

### The Future

Whether we like it or not, UPB applies to everything that we do. Human beings have a natural tendency towards consistency, since we are beings with a rational consciousness, inhabiting a consistent and rational universe. Thus whatever premises we accept in our lives tend to compel more and more consistent behaviour throughout our lives – and throughout the “life” of our culture or nation as well.

Thus a man who believes that bullying is a good way to get what he wants tends to bully more and more over the course of his lifetime. A man who believes that violence is good tends to become more and more violent.

In other words, UPB demands consistency even in inconsistency. UPB demands uniformity even in immorality.

The root moral premises of a culture thus dictate its inevitable future. A culture built on justifications for coercion will always become more coercive. A culture built on rational liberty will always become less coercive.

That is why the delineation of a rational framework for ethics is so essential.

What we believe is what we become.

If we believe lies, we shall become slaves.
