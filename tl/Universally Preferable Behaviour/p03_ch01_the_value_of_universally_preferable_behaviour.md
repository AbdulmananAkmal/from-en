## Ang Kahalagahan ng Pang-unibersal na Kanais-nais na Pag-uugali

Ang bagong teorya ay may mallit na halaga kung pinupunto lamang nito ang nakikita na. Kung ang pisika lamang ay nagkakaloob ng tumpak na paglalarawan kung paano tayo sasalo ng bola, kung gayon ang pisika ay hindi na kapaki-pakinabang na hangarin, dahil *kaya* na nating sumalo ng bola. Discovering that the world is round only aids in long-distance navigation across the sea – it does nothing to help us get down-town Quantum mechanics only becomes useful when other methodologies cannot provide the necessary accuracy – it does not help in building a car.

In the same way, the UPB framework, and the moral rules that it validates or rejects, should ideally provide us with some startling insights about the world that we live in, and our relations to each other.

If all that UPB did was to prove that rape, murder and theft are morally wrong, it would not add much value, since almost no one believes that those things are morally right to begin with.

Thus let us begin applying this framework to the world that we live in, and see what value comes out of it.
