## Ang mga kategorya ng Etika

Sa pamamagitan ng balangkas ng UPB sa lugar, pwede na ngayong usisain ang pagsusuri kung paano napatutunayan o pinawalang-bisa ng UPB ang aming pinakakaraniwang mga panukalang moral na mga problema. Kung ang aming "teyorya ng pisika" ay pwedeng ipaliwanag kung paano mahuhuli ang isang bola ng baseball ng isang tao, mayroon kaming naipasaat ito ang una - at pinakamahalaga - sagabal, at sinaktan ang una at pinakamalalim na suntok laban sa hayop.

### Ang Pitong mga Kategorya

Tulad ng nabanggit sa bandang itaas, ang mga salaysay tungkol sa pag-uugali ng higit sa lahat ay nahulog sa tatlong pangkalahatang kategorya - ang positibo, negatibo at ang neutral. Para matulungan kaming makahiwalay ng mga ahestetika mula sa etika, simulan natin sa pamamagitan ng pagpapalawak ng mga kategoryang ito para mapalibutan *kahit alinmang* pag-uugali na pwedeng mapasa-ilalim sa isang etikal na pagtatasa. Ang pitong mga kategoraya ay mga:

1. Ito ay talagang mabuti (higit na mas mainam at masusunod sa pamamagitan ng pagmamalupit, tulad ng "huwag pumatay").
2. Ito ay ahestetikali na positibo (sa pangkalahatang higit na mas mabuti ngunit hindi maipatupad sa pamamagitan ng kalupitan, gaya ng "kagalang-galang" at "pagiging nasa oras").
3. Ito ay pansarili na positibo (sa alinman sa hindi pangkaraniwang sa lalong kanais-nais o maipapatupad, gaya ng isang paborito para kumain ng ice cream).
4. Ito ay neutral, o walang etikal o ahestetika na nilalaman, gaya ng pagpapatakbo para sa isang bus.
5. Ito ay pansarili na negatibo (paborito para hindi kumain ng ice cream).
6. Ito ay ahestetikali na negatibo ("pagiging bastos" at "pagiging late").
7. Ito ay masama (ipinagbabawal sa lahat) ("panghahalay").

Ideally, we should be able to whittle these down to only two categories – universally preferable and aesthetically positive – by defining our ethical propositions so that what is universally banned is simply a mirror image of what is universally preferable, and ditching merely personal preferences and neutral actions as irrelevant to a discussion of ethics.

For instance, the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) states that the initiation of the use of force is immoral – thus the non-initiation of the use of force is universally preferable, while the initiation of the use of force is universally banned. If what is banned is simply the opposite of what is preferable, there is really no need for an additional category.

Furthermore, as moral philosophers, we must prioritise our examination of rational ethics by focussing on the most egregious violations. Clearly, the most immoral actions must be the violent enforcement of unjust preferences upon others. If actions such as “theft” or “murder” are defined as UPB, the examination of such definitions must be our very highest priority.

Thus we shall focus our efforts primarily on universally preferable and enforceable actions.

### Virtue And Its Opposite

The opposite of “virtue” must be “vice” – the opposite of “good” must be “evil.” If I propose the moral rule, “thou shalt not steal,” then stealing must be evil, and *not* stealing must be good. This does not mean that “refraining from theft” is the sole definition of moral excellence, of course, since a man may be a murderer, but not a thief. We can think of it as a “necessary but not sufficient” requirement for virtue.

Each morally preferable action must by its very nature have an opposite action – because if it does not, then there is no capacity for choice, no possibility of avoidance, and therefore no capacity for virtue or vice. If I propose the moral rule: “thou shalt defy gravity,” then clearly morality becomes impossible, immorality cannot be avoided, and therefore the moral rule must be invalid.

If I propose the moral rule: “thou shalt not go to San Francisco,” this can be logically rephrased as: “thou shalt go anywhere but San Francisco.” In this way, the moral rule “thou shalt not steal” can be equally proposed in the positive form – “thou shalt respect property rights.” Since respecting property rights is a virtue, violating property rights must be a vice.

### What Is Missing

Conspicuously absent from the above list are traditional virtues such as courage, honesty, integrity and so on – as well as their opposites: cowardice, falsehood and corruption.

It may seem that these virtues should fall into the realm of aesthetically positive behaviour, such as being on time, but I for one have far too much respect for the traditional virtues to place them in the same category as social niceties. The reason that they cannot be placed into the category of universally preferable is that, as we mentioned above, the framework of UPB only deals with *behaviours*, not with attitudes, thoughts, states of mind or emotions. The scientific method can process a logical proposition; it cannot process “anger” or “foolhardiness.” These states of mind are not unimportant, of course – in fact, they are essential – but they cannot be part of any objective system for evaluating ethical propositions, since they are essentially subjective – and therefore unprovable – states of being.

Thus UPB can only deal with objectively verifiable actions such as murder, assault and so on.
