## Existence Versus Non-Existence

We define “non-existence” as that which does not possess mass or energy, or display the effects of mass or energy, such as detectable relationships like gravity.

God does not possess mass or energy, or display the effects of mass or energy – God in fact is not detectable or verifiable in any way, shape or form, either through the senses, or through rationality.

Thus if I say, “God exists,” what I am really saying is:

“*That which exists must be detectable; God cannot be detectable, but God exists – therefore that which does not exist, exists.*”

In other words, by saying “God exists,” I have created an insurmountable contradiction. I have defined “existence” as “non-existence,” which makes about as much sense as defining “life” as “inanimate matter,” or a rock as “the opposite of a rock,” or a “square” as a “circle.”

Similarly, if I create some alternate universe where “non-existence equals existence” and “contradiction equals consistency” and “truth equals falsehood” and “irrationality equals rationality,” then what I have really done is create a realm called “error,” put everything in it which is not true, and defined this realm as a place where “error equals truth.”[^2]

Of course, people do not create this “alternate universe” in order to invalidate truth within our own universe, but rather to rescue that which is erroneous in reality, and call it true. For instance, no one who argues “God may exist in another universe, so you cannot claim that God does not exist” ever argues “*I* may not exist in that other universe, so you cannot claim that I exist here.”

They also tend not to respond well to the argument that: “In another universe, you may be agreeing with me that God does not exist, so that makes you an atheist.”[^3]

If valid statements about reality can be endlessly opposed because some imaginary realm called “error equals truth” invalidates them, then what is really being said is “no positive statements about truth can be valid” – however, we are wise enough as philosophers by now to know that this very statement is self-contradictory, since it is a positive statement considered to be true that says that no positive statements can be true. If nothing can be true or false – even that statement – then no statements whatsoever can be made about anything. Using words, using English, using comprehensible sentences – all make no sense whatsoever, since in this “alternative universe” such structured utterances may be complete nonsense. If things which can be true in this alternate universe have an effect on statements we make in this universe, then clearly the reverse is also true, which means that no statements can ever be made about anything, since their exact opposite can be equally true.

The true reality of the statement “error equals truth” is the tautological insanity of “null equals null.”

### The "Alternate Universe" In Human Society

The reason that we have been spending so much time dealing with this “alternate universe” theory is that it has direct relevance to human society, and is used to “justify” the greatest evils which are committed among us.

In our own personal experience, we know that murder is wrong. In working through the proposition that murder is morally wrong in the above examples, I strongly doubt that anyone was shocked to have their moral instincts confirmed through the strict abstract reasoning of UPB. In this section, however, it is officially permissible for you to begin to be truly shocked.

The greatest leaps forward in scientific understanding are the so-called “unifying theories.” Einstein spent decades trying to work out a unified field theory; and theories of physics which unite strong and weak forces, electromagnetism, gravity and so on remain elusive.

UPB as a framework, however, not only justifies our moral instincts at the personal, philosophical and universal levels – but also has profound and shocking implications for human society.

#### UPB In Action

The UPB framework validates moral propositions by demanding that they be internally consistent, and universal in terms of time, place and individuals.

If we accept UPB, we must also accept the following corollary:

- Moral propositions are independent of costume.

What this means is that a man cannot change his moral nature along with his clothing. The act of changing one’s costume does not alter one’s fundamental nature. Thus opposing moral rules cannot be valid based on the clothes one is wearing.

Soldiers, of course, wear costumes that are different from the average citizen. The average citizen is forbidden to murder; soldiers, however, are not only *allowed* to murder, but are morally *praised* for murdering.

Let’s take another example.

Theft is morally wrong, as we have seen above. It is morally wrong for all people in all situations at all times and under all circumstances. Since theft is the forcible removal of somebody else’s property without consent, then taxation is always, universally and forever a moral evil. Taxation is by definition the forcible removal of somebody’s property without their consent, since taxation relies on the initiation of the use of force to strip a man of his property.

What we call “the government” is merely another example of this *null zone* wherein up is down, black is white, truth is falsehood and evil is good.

Society progresses exactly to the degree that reason and evidence make the great leap from the personal to the universal, and destroy any irrational *null zones* in the way. Science progresses exactly to the degree that it rejects the irrationality of God and subjective “absolutes.” Medicine progresses exactly to the degree that it rejects the efficacy of prayer and empty ritual, and instead relies on reason and evidence. Philosophy also – and human society in general – will advance exactly to the degree that it rejects the irrational “square-circle morality” of statist and religious ethical theories.

### 政府

他说政府相反的道德规则从其他社会下运作是完全一样，就像说“妖精免疫重力”。首先，妖精不存在–和的一种方法 - 我们知道他们的行为方式之一不存在的是它声称它们不受重力的影响。首先，妖精不存在–和的一种方法，我们知道他们不存在，他们声称他们是免疫的重力。 所有有质量的物体都受重力的影响，根据定义它对重力不起作用，因此质量不存在。这句话, “妖精是免疫的重力”是一种重言式，它只证实了妖精的不存在–非存在是语义等价的, “不存在是不存在”。 A 是 A，亚里士多德的逻辑的第一定律，是珍贵的确认，它的定义是不存在的的存在。

同样，当我们说谋杀和政府代表偷窃的道德上是好的，我们知道“士兵”和“政府代表”作为道德范畴是完全无效的。

如果我说一个方圆有偷窃的权利，我只是说，那个不存在的权利有权做到自相矛盾的一个 - 纯粹是无意义的陈述，但在政治的“空白地带”仍有奇怪的吸引力。

如果我在一家二手商店买一件士兵服装，穿上它，显然我没有创造出一个相反的道德规则有效的替代宇宙。在我穿上戏服的那一刻，我犯了谋杀罪，那我什么时候能成为凶手呢？我什么时候穿上裤子? 如果我穿裤子，而不是背心怎么办? 如果我有一把靴子怎么办? 如果双靴子都打开了，但只有一个被系上了呢？如果我的帽子倒退怎么办？如果我穿上了我未遇到的第一个人不认可的制服，该怎么办? 披头士乐队在拍摄“警察辣椒队”封面时突然拥有谋杀权吗？他们脱下外套时是否失去了这种权利？

我问这些反问句，因为它们实际上是致命的。很明显，一件军人服装并不能改变一个人的本性，比理发更能使他变成一只鸭子、一个概念或一个神。

“啊，”你可能会说，“但这套服装是无效的，因为你在一家二手商店买到了它 -穿上士兵的制服不再是当兵，而不是复印博士学位给你一个博士学位。”

这种类比是不正确的，因为拥有博士学位或复印博士学位不会改变你作为一个人所受到的任何道德准则。

“嗯，”你可以回答，“但不同的是，士兵拥有一般公民为他提供的道德权利，为了集体自卫等等”。

这引发了一个非常有趣的问题，即意见是否能够改变现实。

### 意见和现实

很明显，我们明白我无法通过我的观点，把你从万有引力的束缚中解放出来，这比我认为“二加二等于五”的看法更符合事实。

“意见”是指那些在现实中没有明确的证据，或者没有明确的证据可以提供，或者仅仅是个人喜好的信念。我个人的观点是我更喜欢巧克力冰淇淋，而不是香草口味的 -我可能也有一种“意见”，认为冰岛是热带天堂，或者上帝存在，或者雨水向上。个人观点显然与道德无关，声称准确地描述现实但却不正确的观点仅仅是不正确的偏见。相信雨水往上流动并不会改变方向，穿夏威夷衬衫去冰岛不会使雷克雅未克变得更温暖。

因此，认为谋杀在道德上是好的并不能使谋杀成为道德上好。因为我对一个人的信念并没有改变他的道德本质，我相信他的谋杀是高尚的，不会改变他行为的美德。如果我闭上眼睛，想象你是一只蜥蜴，你不会突然失去调节体温的能力。想象你是一条鱼并没有绕过你对潜水装备的需求。

意见不会改变现实。

因为意见不会改变现实，我不能允许你对普遍的道德规则给予任何例外或逆转。从道德规则是基于通用的逻辑，以及人类的物理本质和现实，所以我不能授予你“谋杀权”，除了我可以授予你悬浮，在水上行走或准确行事的能力外说两个和两个五个。

### 政府作为自愿主义

政府机构中的开放力量 - 一种颠覆特定群体道德规则的概念包装 -在辩论中总是被忽略。当谈到政府时，指出“屋子里的枪”从来就不是一件积极的事。几乎从定义上来说，政府被认为是由人民选择并为人民所选择，并且以明确或隐含的赞同来运作。

然而，这纯粹是胡说八道。

如果一个人在和她做爱的时候把刀子拿给女人的喉咙，那是强奸的行为。他不能说性是两厢情愿的，同时如果她拒绝和他发生性关系，就要以伤害或死亡威胁她。如果性行为是自愿的，那么这把刀是完全不必要的。如果男人觉得需要一把刀，那么显然性是非自愿的。

同样，人们说税收是他们自愿同意的社会契约的一部分。

这在逻辑上和经验上都是错误的。

我们知道这是经验错误的，因为社会契约没有存在。你和我都没有签署过自愿同意所得税的文件 – –我们只是出生在一个系统，它可以从枪支点拿走我们的钱。

### 房间里的枪

许多人会在这一点上争论说，税收不是从枪的角度实施的，而是人们自愿支付的。举个例子，我从来没有在一个收税人或警察面前用枪指着我的脸，但是我已经交税几十年了。

This may be true, but it is completely irrelevant. If I tell a woman that I will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, and she submits herself to me, we clearly understand that an immoral action has taken place – even though I have used no weapon in my violation. Clearly, if the woman submits to me, it is because she fears that I will carry out my threat. If I told her that my pet leprechaun will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, she would very likely be disturbed, but would not fear my threat in any significant way, since it is impossible for my pet leprechaun to kill her children. Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

[^2]: Let’s not even get *started* on the logical nightmare of the truth value contained in the statement “error equals truth.”

[^3]: This argument tends also not to work very well with maths teachers – I have never seen a student successfully argue that an incorrect answer may be correct in another universe, and so it is unjust to mark it as wrong.
