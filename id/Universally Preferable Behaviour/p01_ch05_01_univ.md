## Perilaku yang Lebih Baik secara Universal

Sebagai hasil dari argumen di atas, kita dapat melihat bahwa tidak mungkin untuk masuk ke dalam perdebatan apapun tanpa menerima tempat bahwa perilaku tertentu *lebih disukai secara universal*.

Saya menggunakan kata"perilaku" di sini dari pada "berpikir" karena penting untuk membedakan antara keadaan internal dan tidak dapat disahkan murni seperti "pemikiran" dari negara-negara yang obyektif dan dapat disahkan seperti "akting," "menulis" dan"berbicara".

Tidak mungkin membuktikan bahwa saya mengimpikan seekor gajah tadi malam. Ada kemungkinan untuk membuktikan bahwa saya telah menulis kata "gajah," oleh karena itu saya menggunakan kata "tingkah laku" daripada "pikiran".

Mengakuisisi ke logika unggul dalam sebuah argumen adalah * action </ 0>. Jika, setiap kali saya memberikan satu poin kepada Anda, saya tidak mengatakan apa-apa, tapi hanya menatap Anda dengan kosong, Anda akan merasa agak sulit untuk memperdebatkan saya. Untuk mengakui satu poin, saya harus melakukan tindakan persetujuan lisan.</p> 

Dengan demikian dapat dilihat bahwa, yang melekat dalam tindakan berdebat adalah sejumlah tempat tertanam yang tidak dapat dibalikkan dapat dibalikkan.

Jika saya meminta Anda untuk menemuiku di lapangan tenis, dan menampakkan diri dengan senapan berburu, kita mungkin akan bermain olah raga, tapi pastinya tidak akan tenis. Ketika saya meminta Anda untuk menemuiku di lapangan tenis untuk sebuah pertandingan, tersirat dalam permintaan itu adalah penerimaan peraturan tenis.

Secara historis, mereka yang terlibat dalam perdebatan etis sering gagal mempertahankan kenyataan dasar ini.

Saya tidak bisa mengirimkan sebuah makalah ilmiah yang ditulis dalam bahasa saya sendiri, mengklaim bahwa itu telah disahkan oleh ikan mas batiniah saya, dan diharapkan dapat dianggap serius. Demikian pula, saya tidak bisa memulai debat filosofis tentang etika dengan mengacu pada nilai pribadi saya sendiri, dan mengklaim bahwa argumen saya semua telah disahkan oleh Trixie si leprechaun yang maha tahu dan tak terlihat, dan berharap dapat dianggap serius.

Tindakan perdebatan mengharuskan penerimaan perilaku yang lebih baik secara universal (UPB). Tidak ada cara untuk secara rasional menanggapi argumen etis *tanpa* yang menunjukkan UPB.

Sekarang mari kita beralih ke serangkaian bukti positif untuk UPB.

### UPB Dan Validitas

Salah satu tantangan utama yang dihadapi oleh para filsuf moderen adalah kebutuhan untuk membuktikan bahwa peraturan moral keduanya mungkin dan universal. Until moral rules can be subjected to the same rigour and logic as any other propositions, we will forever be stymied by subjectivism, political prejudices and the pragmatic “argument from effect.”

The closest historical analogy to our present situation occurred in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, during the rise of the scientific method. The early pioneers who advocated a rational and empirical approach to knowledge faced the same prejudices that we face today – all the same irrationalities, entrenched powers of church and state, mystical and subjective “absolutes” and early educational barriers. Those who advocated the primacy of rationality and empirical observation over Biblical fundamentalism and secular tyrannies faced the determined opposition of those wielding both cross and sword. Many were tortured to death for their intellectual honesty – we face far less risk, and so should be far more courageous in advocating what is *true* over what is *believed*.

In order to attack false moralities, we must start from the beginning, just as the first scientists did. Francis Bacon did not argue that the scientific method was more “efficient” than prayer, Bible texts or starvation-induced visions. He simply said that if we want to understand nature, we must observe nature and theorise logically – and that there is *no other* route to knowledge.

We must take the same approach in defining and communicating *morality*. We must begin using the power and legitimacy of the scientific method to prove the validity and universality of moral laws. We must start from the beginning, build logically and reject *any* irrational or non-empirical substitutes for the truth.

What does this look like in practice? All we have to do is establish the following axioms:

- Morality is a valid concept.
- Moral rules must be consistent for all mankind.
- The validity of a moral theory is judged by its consistency.

To start from the very beginning… are moral rules – or universally preferable human behaviours – valid at all?

There are only two possibilities when it comes to moral rules, just as there are in any logical science. Either universal moral rules are valid, or they are not.[^6]

A rule can be valid if it *exists empirically*, like gravity, or because it is *true*, like the equation two plus two equals four.

We must then first ask: do moral rules exist at all?

Certainly not in material reality, which does not contain or obey a single moral rule. Moral rules are different from the rules of physics, just as the scientific method is different from gravity. Matter innately obeys gravity or the second law of thermodynamics, but “thou shalt not murder” is nowhere inscribed in the nature of things. Physical laws *describe* the behaviour of matter, but do not contain a single *prescription*. Science says that matter *does* behave in a certain manner – never that it *should* behave in a certain manner. A theory of gravity proves that if you push a man off a cliff, he will fall. It will not tell you whether you *should* push him or not.

Thus it cannot be said that moral rules exist in material reality, and neither are they automatically obeyed like the laws of physics – which does *not* mean that moral laws are false, subjective or irrelevant. The scientific method itself does not exist in reality either – and is also optional – but it is not at all false, subjective or irrelevant.

If we can prove that moral theories can be objective, rational and verifiable, this will provide the same benefits to ethics that subjecting *physical* theories to the scientific method did.

Before the rise of the scientific method, people believed that matter obeyed the subjective whims of gods and devils – and people believe the same of morality now. Volcanoes erupted because the mountain-god was angry; good harvests resulted from human or animal sacrifices. No one believed that absolute physical laws could limit the will of the gods – and so science could never develop. Those who historically profited from defining physical reality as subjective – mostly priests and aristocrats – fought the subjugation of physical theories to the scientific method, just as those who currently profit from defining morality as subjective – mostly priests and politicians – currently fight the subjugation of *moral* theories to objective and universal principles.

As mentioned above, the scientific method is essentially a methodology for separating accurate from inaccurate theories by subjecting them to two central tests: logical consistency and empirical observation – and by always subjugating logical consistency to empirical observation. If I propose a perfectly consistent and logical theory that says that a rock will float *up* when thrown off a cliff, any empirical test proves my theory incorrect, since observation always trumps hypothesis.

A further aspect of the scientific method is the belief that, since matter is composed of combinations of atoms with common, stable and predictable properties, the behaviour of matter must also be common, stable and predictable. Thus experiments must be *reproducible* in different locations and times. I cannot say that my “rock floating” theory is correct for just one particular rock, or on the day I first tested it, or at a single location. My theories must describe the behaviour of *matter*, which is universal, common, stable and predictable.

Finally, there is a generally accepted rule – sometimes called Occam’s Razor – which states that, of any two theories that have the same predictive power, the simpler of the two is preferable. Prior to the Copernican revolution, when Earth was considered the centre of the universe, the retrograde motion of Mars when Earth passed it in orbit around the sun caused enormous problems to the Ptolemaic system of astronomical calculations. “Circles within circles” multiplied enormously, which were all cleared away by simply placing the sun at the centre of the solar system and accepting the elliptical nature of planetary orbits.

Thus any valid scientific theory must be (a) universal (b) logical (c) empirically verifiable (d) reproducible and (e) as simple as possible.

The methodology for judging and proving a *moral* theory is exactly the same as the methodology for judging and proving any other theory.

#### Moral Rules: A Definition

The first question regarding moral rules is: *what* are they?

Simply put, *morals* are a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify universally preferable human behaviours, just as *physics* is a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify the universal behaviour of matter.

The second question to be asked is: is there any such thing as “universally preferable behaviour” at all? If there is, we can begin to explore what such behaviour might be. If not, then our examination must stop here – just as the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy ceased after it became commonly accepted that the Sun was in fact the centre of the solar system.

[^6]: In physics, the question is: either universal physical rules are valid, or they are not.
