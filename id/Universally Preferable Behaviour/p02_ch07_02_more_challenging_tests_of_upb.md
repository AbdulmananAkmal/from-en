### "Don't Eat Fish"

Apa status proposisi moral: "Adalah jahat untuk makan ikan"?

Jelas, proposisi ini tampaknya memenuhi setidaknya beberapa persyaratan UPB - tampaknya bersifat universal, tidak tergantung pada waktu dan tempat, dan relatif objektif.

Namun, sulit bagi kita untuk secara wajar menyebutnya sebagai *moral* teori - mengapa?

Pertama-tama, "kejahatan" mencakup tindakan yang dapat dicegah melalui penggunaan kekerasan. Pemerkosaan adalah "jahat," dan karena itu saya dapat menggunakan kekuatan untuk membela diri terhadap seseorang yang mencoba memperkosa saya.

Bisakah saya menembak orang yang makan sepotong ikan dengan adil?

Kelihatannya konyol untuk membantah bahwa saya bisa - tapi mengapa?

Ada beberapa batasan objektif untuk universalitas doktrin ini. Misalnya, beberapa orang mungkin tidak memiliki akses terhadap ikan - mereka mungkin tinggal di padang pasir, katakan - sementara yang lain hidup di tepi danau yang dipenuhi ikan, dan merasa sulit atau tidak mungkin bertahan hidup tanpa memakannya. Namun, itu tidak bisa cukup, karena kita telah menerima kenyataan bahwa ketidakmampuan seorang kasim untuk memperkosa tidak membuat keputusan moral yang tidak benar "adalah jahat untuk diperkosa."

No, the “red herring” in the moral proposition “It is evil to eat fish” is the word “*fish*.”

Seorang ilmuwan tidak dapat secara sah mengatakan bahwa teorinya tentang gravitasi hanya berlaku untuk bebatuan merah muda. Karena teorinya melibatkan gravitasi, ia harus berlaku untuk *semua* entitas yang memiliki massa.

Similarly, in the example above, UPB accepts only the *act* of eating, and rejects *what* is being eaten, since what is being eaten is not an *action*, but rather what is being acted upon.

Dengan cara yang sama, seorang ahli etika tidak dapat secara sah mengemukakan proposisi moral: "Adalah jahat untuk memperkosa *orang tua*." "Perkosaan" adalah tingkah lakunya; apakah korban sudah tua atau tidak tidak relevan dengan proposisi moral, karena selama korbannya manusia, persyaratan untuk universalitas tetap konstan. “Thou shalt not steal” is a valid moral proposition according to UPB – “thou shalt not steal *turnips*” is not, for the simple reason that theft is related to the concept of property – and turnips, as a subset of property, cannot be rationally delineated from all other forms of property and assigned their own moral rule.

The moral proposition “eating fish is evil” thus fails the test of universality because it is too specific to be generalised – it is like saying “my theory of gravity applies only to pink rocks.” If it is a theory of gravity, then it must apply to everything; if it only applies to pink rocks, then it is not a theory of gravity.

UPB also rejects as invalid any theory that results in opposing moral judgements for identical actions. “Assault” cannot be moral one day, and immoral the next. Thus we know that “eating” cannot be moral one day, and immoral the next.

Either “eating” is moral, immoral, or morally neutral. If eating is immoral, then a whole host of logical problems arise, which I am sure we are quite familiar with by now.

If, on the other hand, eating is *moral*, then it cannot be moral to eat a cabbage, and immoral to eat a fish, since that is a violation of universality, insofar as the same action – eating – is judged both good and bad.

It is in this way that we understand that the proposition “eating *fish* is evil” fails the test of UPB, and is not valid as a moral theory.

### Animal Rights

We do not have the time here to go into a full discussion of the question of animal rights, but we can at least deal with the moral proposition: “it is evil to kill fish.”

If it is evil to kill fish, then UPB says that anyone or anything that kills the fish is evil. This would include not just fishermen, but sharks as well – since if killing fish is evil, we have expanded our definition of ethical “actors” to include non-human life.

It is clear that sharks do not have the capacity to refrain from killing fish, since they are basically eating machines with fins.

Thus we end up with the logical problem of “inevitable evil.” If it is evil to kill fish, but sharks cannot avoid killing fish, then sharks are “inevitably evil.” However, as we have discussed above, where there is no choice – where *avoidability* is impossible – there can be no morality. Thus the proposition “it is evil to kill fish” attempts to define a universal morality that includes non-moral situations, which cannot stand logically.

Also, the word “fish” remains problematic in the formulation, since it is too specific to be universal. The proper UPB reformulation is: “it is evil for people to kill living organisms.”

If, however, it is evil to kill, we again face the problem of “inevitable evil.” No human being can exist without killing other organisms such as viruses, plants, or perhaps animals. Thus “human life” is defined as “evil.” But if human life is defined as evil, then it cannot *be* evil, since avoidance becomes impossible.

What if we say: “it is evil to kill people” – would that make a man-eating shark evil?

No – once again, since sharks have no capacity to avoid killing people, they cannot be held responsible for such actions, any more than a landslide can be taken to court if it kills a man.

UPB allows for exceptions based on objective and universal material or biological differences, just as other sciences do. The scientific theory that gases expand when heated applies, of course, only to gases. I cannot invalidate the theory by proving that it does not apply to, say, plastic.

In the same way, morality only applies to rational consciousness, due to the requirement for avoidability. If I attempt to apply a moral theory to a snail, a tree, a rock, or the concept “numbers,” I am attempting to equate rational consciousness with entities that may be neither rational nor conscious, which is a logical contradiction. I might as well say that the Opposite Angle Theorem in geometry is invalid because it does not apply to a circle, or a cloud. The OAT only applies to intersecting lines – attempting to apply it to other situations is the conceptual equivalent of attempting to paint air.

In other words, misapplication is not disproof.

There are many other “grey areas” that we could work on, from abortion to intellectual property rights to restitution and so on, but I think that it is far more important to take UPB out of the realm of abstraction, and begin applying it to the real world problems we face today.
