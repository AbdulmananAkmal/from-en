## Introduction

Untuk generasi yang tak terhitung jumlahnya, umat manusia hidup dalam semacam rahim egosentris dari ketidaktahuan yang dipaksakan sendiri: dunia datar, matahari, bulan dan bintang berputar di sekelilingnya, nenek moyang memberi isyarat kepadanya dari balik kabut kematian, dan guntur adalah kemarahan dari dewa-dewa.

Beranjak keluar dari rahim nistik interpretasi subyektif ini membutuhkan tenaga kerja ribuan tahun - dan menghabiskan jutaan nyawa. The effort required to wrench our perspective from *perceptual experience* to *conceptual logic* was terrifying, exhilarating, highly disorienting and extremely dangerous. Understanding that the world was not what it *felt like*, or *seemed like*, was – and remains – the greatest feat of our intelligence. The *truth* of reality turned out to be in the eyes of the mind, not of the flesh.

Dunia terlihat datar; bukan itu. Matahari dan bulan terlihat sama ukurannya; mereka tidak. Bintang-bintang nampaknya bergerak mengelilingi bumi; mereka tidak. Learning the truth requires that we see the world from outside our senses – this does not mean a rejection of our senses, but an airtight compliance with the *real* evidence of the senses, which is not that the world is flat, but that matter, energy and physical laws are consistent. When we let go of a rock in our hand, it falls – this is the *real* evidence of the senses, not that the Earth is fixed and immovable. Gagasan bahwa dunia tidak bergerak adalah anggapan salah yang bertentangan dengan bukti langsung indra kita, yaitu bahwa segala sesuatu akan jatuh. Jika semuanya jatuh, dunia tidak dapat diperbaiki dan tidak tergoyahkan.

Inilah kebenaran kecil sehari-hari; Batu karang jatuh, asap naik, api panas dan matahari dan bulan keduanya bulat. If we remain steadfastly and rigorously committed to these “little truths,” we can in time derive the great truths of physics, which provide us such awesome knowledge and power.

Di antara kebenaran kecil dan kebenaran besar, bagaimanapun, adalah ilusi yang membutakan kita - baik dalam fisika maupun etika.

Dalam fisika, kebenaran besar tidak bisa bertentangan dengan kebenaran kecil. Tidak ada "teori medan terpadu" yang secara sah dapat bertentangan dengan pengalaman langsung kita tentang batu yang jatuh atau nyala api yang meningkat. Teori matematika terbesar tidak dapat berlaku jika menerapkannya mengembalikan perubahan yang salah di meja kasir.

Secara historis, bagaimanapun, di antara kebenaran kecil kita sendiri dan kebenaran besar terletak apa yang akan saya sebut "zona nol."

### The "Null Zone"

Kami menyuruh anak-anak kita untuk tidak saling memukul, dan kami percaya bahwa kekerasan salah dalam abstrak, sebagai aturan moral umum. The “little truth” is: *don’t punch*. The “great truth” is: *violence is wrong*.

Namun, ada dalam pikiran kita entitas imajiner yang disebut "Tuhan," dan entitas ini dianggap sangat bermoral. Sayangnya, entitas ini terus-menerus dan secara kasar melanggar dekrit bahwa "kekerasan itu salah" dengan menenggelamkan dunia, menyerahkan jiwa ke neraka meskipun memiliki pengetahuan awal yang tepat tentang "keputusan mereka," yang menyetujui pemerkosaan, pembunuhan, pencurian, penyerangan dan tindakan lain yang akan kita kutuk. sama jahatnya dengan individu manapun.

Thus we have the little truth (*don’t punch*) and the great truth (*violence is wrong*) but in the middle, we have this “null zone” *where the complete opposite of both our little truths and our great truths is considered perfectly true*.

Secara historis, kita bisa melihat inkonsistensi yang sama dalam fisika. Tidak ada lingkaran sempurna dalam pengalaman langsung kita, namun karena kepercayaan kepada Tuhan, semua gerak planet harus menjadi "lingkaran sempurna" - sebuah premis yang memperlambat astronomi selama berabad-abad. Similarly, if a man turns his head, he does not reasonably believe that the entire world rotates around him – and he would happily put this forward as not just his own “little truth,” but as a *great truth*, or universal principle. Namun untuk sebagian besar sejarah manusia, diyakini bahwa bintang dan planet berputar mengelilingi Bumi, dan bukan yang diputar di Bumi. Di sini sekali lagi kita bisa melihat "zona nol" antara pengalaman langsung dan prinsip universal, dimana prinsip-prinsip yang berlawanan sama-sama dianggap benar.

Tidak ada orang waras yang mengalami Tuhan secara langsung. In his daily life, he fully accepts that *that which cannot be perceived does not exist*. Tidak ada orang yang masuk akal tersentak setiap kali dia mengambil langkah, takut akan dinding tak terlihat yang mungkin menghalangi jalannya. Abstraksi terbesar sains mendukung pendekatannya.

Conversely, in the “null zone” of religion, the *exact opposite* of both the little truths and the great truths is believed to be true. Personally, a man believes that *that which cannot be perceived does not exist* – intellectually, science has proven this repeatedly. However, in the “null zone” of theology, the exact opposite proposition holds true – the axiom there is *that which cannot be perceived **must** exist*.

Keyakinan kita akan kebajikan militer juga terletak pada "zona nol" ini. Jika seorang pria pribadi dibayar untuk membunuh orang lain, kita memanggilnya "senjata untuk dipekerjakan," dan mengutuknya sebagai orang yang paling tidak beruntung. If, however, this man puts on a green costume with certain ribbons *and commits the same act*, we hail him as a hero and reward him with a pension. The little truth (*I should not murder*) is perfectly consistent with the great truth (*murder is wrong*) – yet in the middle there lies a “null zone,” where murder magically becomes “virtuous.”

Jika "zona nol" ini benar, maka tidak ada proposisi logis yang bisa dipegang. Jika proposisi benar - dan kebalikan dari proposisi itu juga benar - maka penalaran logis menjadi tidak mungkin. Pertumbuhan ilmu pengetahuan rasional telah menjadi serangan mantap atas "zona nol" ini, dan penyerapan konsistensi objektif ke dalam kantong kecil gila ini.

Di peta lama, sebelum para pembuat peta telah menyelesaikan penjelajahan mereka, gambar tanah yang diketahui akan pudar menjadi kertas kosong. Pertumbuhan pengetahuan pertama-tama memerlukan penggambaran dari apa yang tidak diketahui, dan kemudian perluasan prinsip-prinsip yang dikenal ke dalam area yang tidak diketahui.

Hal yang sama juga terjadi di ranah moralitas.

### The Casualties

Crossing this “null zone” is fraught with peril. Jalan dari kebenaran kecil menuju kebenaran besar diaspal dengan tulang jutaan orang. Dari kematian Sokrates hingga penyiksaan ilmuwan awal oleh para fanatik religius, kepada jutaan orang yang telah membunuh dan meninggal karena fantasi hitam fasisme dan komunisme, dorongan pengetahuan manusia ke dalam "zona nol" penuh dengan bahaya yang cukup besar.

Must “crossing the null zone” – or seamlessly uniting the little truths with the great truths – inevitably be so difficult and dangerous? It is an enormous challenge to unite the perceptual with the conceptual in a straight line of logical reasoning – but *must* this progress take thousands of years and oceans of blood?

Jika kita melihat kemajuan teknologi dan ekonomi umat manusia, kita melihat lebih banyak garis datar untuk ribuan tahun yang tak terhitung jumlahnya, diikuti oleh lonjakan besar dan asimtotik dalam beberapa ratus tahun terakhir. Tidak dapat dibayangkan bahwa beberapa mutasi genetik yang meluas dapat menyebabkan percepatan konsistensi intelektual dan kesuksesan material yang tiba-tiba dan luar biasa ini. Theories claiming that a certain “snowball effect” came into existence, mysteriously propelled by an accumulation of all the little increments of knowledge that had occurred since the dawn of civilisation, can usually be dismissed out of hand as entirely *ex post facto* explanations, since they have no predictive value.

If we understand that our staggering potential has been available to us for at least tens of thousands of years – and that there is both great profit and great pleasure in exercising it – then it at once becomes clear that we really *do* want to use our amazing minds.

Jadi harus ada kekuatan ke bawah yang secara historis bertindak untuk menghancurkan dan memperbudak kebebasan alam umat manusia.

Dalam dunia sains, tidaklah sulit untuk melihat kekuatan penindas yang terus-menerus membuat pikiran kita nyaris tak dikenal. Kombinasi takhayul dalam bentuk agama, dan kekerasan dalam bentuk aristokrasi, mengancam pemikir rasional dengan intimidasi, pemenjaraan, penyiksaan, dan pembunuhan. Sama seperti keuntungan petani dari rendahnya kecerdasan sapi, dan pemilik budak memperoleh keuntungan dari ketakutan para budaknya, para imam dan raja mempertahankan hak istimewa mereka dengan mengancam siapa pun yang berani berpikir.

The simple truth is that “priests” and “kings” were – and are – merely men. The simple truth is that the gods and devils that were supposed to justify their rule never existed.

We have made great strides in understanding the nature and reality of simple human equality, but the sad fact of the matter is that the realm of *morality* is still lost in the “null zone” – in the destructive illusions of the “middle truths.”

### "Middle Truths"

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

These “middle truths” are the most dangerous illusions of all, because they grant the *appearance* of truth while actually *attacking* the truth.

By providing the illusion that we have found the truth, “middle truths” actually prevent us from gaining the truth. They are the last line of defence for fantasy, predation and exploitation.

Since they are not only irrational, but *anti*-rational, “middle truths” remain endlessly flexible – as long as they serve those in power. For instance, Christianity arose out of the growing fascism of the late Roman Empire partly by lashing out at the “primitive” superstitions of existing theologies. “Forget your old gods, we have a brand new God who is far better!”

“Middle truths” always take the form of a truth, followed by a lie. “Zeus is a pagan superstition” is a true statement, which was openly made by Christian proselytisers. The lie that followed was: “Yahweh is not a pagan superstition, but a real and living God.”

We can personalise this a little bit more with an example that will be familiar to anyone who has ever counselled a dysfunctional friend. “My last boyfriend was a real jerk,” she will say, and you will fervently agree. “My new boyfriend is really *great* though,” she will add, and you will try not to roll your eyes.

It is very hard not to replace one illusion with another.

“The British government is a tyranny!” cried the American revolutionaries in the eighteenth century – and, after evicting the British troops, they then set up their own government and started attacking their own citizens.

“Aristocracy is an unjust abomination!” cried other revolutionaries, who then set up the tyranny of the majority in the form of democracy.

“Middle truths” can also exist in science, and similarly prevent the natural progress from the little truths to the great truths. Until the eighteenth century, for instance, biologists believed in “spontaneous generation,” or the idea that life can spring from nonliving matter. This had never been observed, of course, but conformed to ancient writings both philosophical and religious, and so was accepted as fact. Also, prior to the Einsteinian revolution in 1905, light was believed to move through a fixed and invisible substance called “luminiferous ether,” just as sound waves move through air. No scientist who believed in this theory had any empirical evidence for this “ether,” either personally or scientifically – but it was considered necessary to conform to other observable characteristics.

Religion is also another “middle truth” – one of the most dangerous ones. It is true that we are a unique species in the universe, as far as we know. A giraffe is a taller quadruped, but man is not just a “smarter” primate, but something quite different. The nature of that difference remains largely unknown – the religious explanation of “we are not the same as animals because we have a soul and were created by a God” is just another example of a “middle truth.” It is true that we are very different from animals. It is not true that we were created by a god and have a soul.

Just as some parasites cannot take root until they dislodge the prior parasites, “middle truths” only attack previous illusions *so that they can take their place*. Those who are sceptical of the prior fantasies are drawn towards the new fantasy. Thus does Christianity displace paganism, Marxism displace Christianity, post-modernism displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy, and so on.

Until the great truths are achieved, and united with the little truths, “middle truths” are just a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods – specifically designed to prevent the achievement of the great truths.

And the great truths are always achieved from the little truths.

The world falls because a rock falls.

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

Biologically, parasitism is a wholly viable survival strategy for many creatures. In the absence of ethical norms, stealing energy and resources from other creatures is perfectly sensible. In general, the most sustainable and stable form of parasitism is *symbiosis*, or mutually beneficial coexistence. Thus the bacteria that inhabit our intestines aid their own survival by helping us digest our food.

However, a virus that renders us continually exhausted, and barely able to keep ourselves alive, can scarcely be called “mutually beneficial.” If we think of our long and grim history of disaster, starvation, war, disease and poverty – and compare it with the astounding material successes of modernity – it is clear that a form of parasitism tyrannised our minds and capacities for millennia. Now that the last few hundred years have shown the power and creativity of the human spirit, we can view our species as an organism that has shaken off a terrible parasite, and sprung from an endless gasping deathbed to perform the most astounding feats of gymnastics.

When we cure ourselves of a disease, we feel better, but the disease does not. From the perspective of the smallpox virus, the smallpox vaccine is genocidal.

In the same way, the parasites that strangle mankind view the liberty of the majority with horror. Since their parasitism frees them from the demands of reality – to earn their daily bread – they inevitably view the freedom of the masses as a form of enslavement for themselves. Thus would a farmer view the “liberation” of his livestock as an utter disaster…

Establishing truth necessarily limits fantasy. Limiting fantasy necessarily limits exploitation. If I can convince you that I am a living man-God, and that the God who birthed me wants you to give me ten percent of your income, or you will be punished for eternity, then I can become exceedingly rich. I am a parasite of illusions, and depend on those illusions for my sustenance as surely as fungus relies on warmth, dampness – and darkness.

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you.

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

Namun, ketika agen pemerintah mengirimi Anda sebuah surat yang meminta Anda membayar uang kepadanya, Anda mungkin akan merasakan penghinaan tertentu, namun Anda tidak akan menghubungkan cerita tersebut dengan ngeri dan kemarahan yang sama terhadap teman Anda.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
