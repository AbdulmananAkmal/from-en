## UPB: Etika atau Estetika?

In general, we will use the term *aesthetics* to refer to non-enforceable preferences – universal or personal – while *ethics* or *morality* will refer to enforceable preferences. It is *universally preferable* (i.e. required) to use the scientific method to validate physical theories, but we cannot use force to *inflict* the scientific method on those who do not use it, since *not using the scientific method is not a violent action*. Non-violent actions by their very nature are *avoidable*. Jika seorang fisikawan berhenti menggunakan metode ilmiah, tapi malah mulai berkonsultasi dengan kartu tarot, dia tidak memaksakan pilihannya pada saya, dan saya dapat menghindarinya. Seorang pemerkosa, di sisi lain, secara kasar menimbulkan kesukaannya pada korbannya.

Meskipun kami pertama kali berfokus pada UPB dalam bidang etika, UPB sekarang dapat dilihat sebagai "istilah umum", yang mencakup disiplin semacam itu seperti:

- Metode ilmiahnya
- Logika
- Empirisme
- Debat
- Bahasa
- Etika

Ethics is the subset of UPB which deals with *inflicted* behaviour, or the use of violence. Any theory that justifies or denies the use of violence is a *moral* theory, and is subject to the requirements of logical consistency and empirical evidence.

Mari kita lihat tiga tindakan, untuk membantu kita membedakan lebih jauh antara etika dan estetika. The first action is *irrationality*; the second is *lying*; the third is *murder*.[^9]

### Irasionalitas

Katakanlah bahwa Anda dan saya sedang berdebat tentang keberadaan Tuhan. Setelah saya mengajukan argumen saya, Anda bertepuk tangan di telinga Anda, bernyanyi bahwa Tuhan mengatakan kepada Anda bahwa Dia ada, dan karena itu semua argumen saya tidak berarti apa-apa. Jelas, tanggapan Anda terhadap posisi saya tidak masuk akal. Namun, menyebalkan mungkin aku akan menemukan perilaku Anda, walaupun, sepertinya tidak masuk akal bagiku untuk melampiaskan rasa frustanku dengan menarik pistol dan menembakmu. I believe that it is *universally preferable* to use logic and evidence rather than rely on voices in our heads, but this universal preference is not reasonably enforceable in the *physical* sense, through violence or the threat thereof.

### Bohong

Katakanlah bahwa Anda dan saya menetapkan peraturan untuk sebuah perdebatan, dan kami berdua setuju untuk menilai pertanyaan tentang keberadaan Tuhan sesuai dengan akal dan bukti. If, as the debate continues, you fall back to a position of blind faith, and reject my arguments *despite* their rationality and evidence, you are not keeping your word. Dengan kata lain, Anda berbohong saat mengatakan bahwa pertanyaan akan diputuskan oleh akal dan bukti.

Perbedaan antara dua situasi ini (irasionalitas versus berbohong) adalah perbedaan antara kesepakatan kontrak dan non-kontrak. Jika saya menyerahkan seratus dolar dan kemudian pergi, saya tidak dapat dengan adil mendatangi Anda dalam setahun dan mengatakan bahwa Anda sekarang berutang seratus dolar, karena itu adalah pinjaman. Jika, di sisi lain, Anda setuju untuk membayar uang kembali saya dalam setahun, dan kemudian gagal melakukannya, itu adalah situasi yang sangat berbeda.

Dalam contoh "berbohong," meskipun Anda telah benar-benar menghancurkan kata-kata Anda, dan menyia-nyiakan waktuku, tidak akan menjadi moral atau masuk akal bagiku untuk mencabut pistol dan menembakmu.

Sebuah teori moral yang masuk akal harus bisa menjelaskan mengapa hal ini terjadi.

### Pembunuhan

Jika Anda menertawakan saya dengan membawa pisau, beberapa orang akan membantah hak saya untuk membela diri. Jika memotret Anda adalah satu-satunya cara agar saya bisa memastikan keselamatan saya sendiri, biasanya akan dianggap sebagai kebutuhan yang disesalkan.

### Persyaratan untuk Etika

Prasyarat tertentu harus ada, atau diterima, agar penilaian etis atau teori memiliki validitas atau penerapan. Jelas, pilihan dan tanggung jawab pribadi harus keduanya diterima sebagai aksioma. Jika sebuah batu meluncur turun menuruni bukit dan menabrak mobil Anda, kita tidak menahan batu yang bertanggung jawab secara moral, karena tidak memiliki kesadaran, tidak dapat memilih, dan karena itu tidak dapat memiliki tanggung jawab pribadi. If the rock dislodged simply as a result of time and geology, then no one is responsible for the resulting harm to your car. If, however, you saw me push the rock out of its position, you would not blame the rock, but rather me. To add a further complication, if it turns out that I dislodged the rock because another man forced me to at gunpoint, you would be far more likely to blame the gun-toting initiator of the situation rather than me.

As we have discussed above, entering into any debate requires an acceptance of the realities of choice, values and personal responsibility. However, these factors are also present in the choice of the colour of paint for a room, yet we would scarcely say that selecting a hue is a *moral* choice. Thus there must be other criteria which must be present in order for a choice or proposition to be moral.

We all have preferences – from the merely personal (“I like ice cream”) to the socially preferable (“It is good to be on time”) to universal morality (“Thou shalt not murder”).

There is little point writing a book about personal preferences – and we can turn to Ann Landers for a discussion of socially preferable behaviour – here, then, we will focus on the possibility of *Universally Preferable Behaviour*.

### Choice

If I accept your invitation to a dinner party, but find the conversation highly offensive, I can decide to get up and leave – and I can also choose to never accept another invitation from you. This capacity for escape and/or avoidance is an essential characteristic differentiating *aesthetics* from *ethics*.

If, however, when I decide to leave your dinner party, you leap up and chain me to my chair, clearly I no longer have the free choice to leave. This is the moment at which your rudeness becomes overt aggression, and crosses the line from aesthetics to ethics.

If, after vowing monogamy, I cheat on my wife, and she decides to leave me, I have certainly done her wrong, but the wrong that I have done by cheating would be very different from the wrong I would do if I lock her in the basement to prevent her from leaving. We would not generally consider a wife who shoots her husband for infidelity to be acting morally, but we would recognise the regrettable necessity if she had to use violence to escape from her imprisonment. In the first situation, the wife has the free choice and capacity to *leave* her husband, and thus violence would be an unjust response to the situation; in the second situation, her choice to leave her husband has been eliminated through imprisonment. Infidelity does not destroy a partner’s capacity to choose; locking her in the basement does.

### Avoidance

If you and I are both standing at the top of a cliff, and I turn to you and say, “Stand in front of me, so I can push you off the cliff,” what would your response be? If you do voluntarily stand in front of me, and I then push you off the cliff, this would more likely be considered a form of suicide on your part, rather than murder on my part. The reason for this is that you can very easily *avoid* being pushed off the cliff, simply by refusing to stand in front of me.

Similarly, if I meet you in a bar, and say: “I want you to come back to my place, so I can tie you to the bed and starve you to death,” if you do in fact come back to my place, it is with the reasonable knowledge that your longevity will not be enhanced by your decision. On the other hand, if I slip a “date rape” drug into your drink, and you wake up tied to my bed, it is clear that there is little you could have done to avoid the situation.

This question of *avoidance* is key to differentiating aesthetics from ethics. Aesthetics applies to situations that may be unpleasant, but which do not eliminate your capacity to choose.

#### Avoidance And Initiation

There is a particular issue with avoidance that will come up later in this book, which is worth clearing up here beforehand.

If I live on a high mountaintop five thousand kilometres away from you, and send you an e-mail telling you that if you ever walk in front of my house, I am going to shoot you, it is relatively easy for you to avoid this situation. My threat of force is certainly immoral, but questions would surely be raised if you immediately jumped on a plane, climbed my mountain and slowly strolled in front of my house.

On the other hand, if you live on a dead-end street, and I tell you that if you take that street to get home, I will shoot you, your capacity to avoid this situation becomes significantly limited. You could certainly tunnel into your house, or jump over a bunch of backyard fences, but all of this would be considerably inconvenient.

In a similar manner, if a representative of organised crime comes to my house and threatens to burn it down if I do not pay regular protection money, I can avoid that specific threat by moving to another continent, but that would seem like a rather unjust way to deal with the situation, since I must now initiate action in order to avoid the threat.

For the moment, we can assume that *any* threat of the initiation of violence is immoral, but the question of avoidance – particularly the *degree* of avoidance required – is also important. In general, the more that a threat interferes with the normal course of daily actions, the more egregious it is. If I have to fly to another continent in order to walk in front of your house, that is scarcely an everyday activity. If I am threatened with violence for walking down the only road towards my own home, that is a far worse intrusion upon my liberties. If I have to take specific and unprecedented action to trigger a threat, that is one thing – if I trigger the threat through normal everyday activities, that is quite another. Telling you I will slap you if you stand on your head on the dark side of the moon is scarcely a threat – telling you I will slap you if you *breathe* is.

### Ethics, Aesthetics, And Avoidability

Let’s say that you and I agree to meet at a certain location at six o’clock sharp – but then I show up half an hour late. What would your reaction be? At first, you may be a little annoyed. If I tell you that I was delayed because I stopped to give a dying man CPR and saved his life, your annoyance would likely be replaced with admiration. On the other hand, if I tell you that I am late because I was playing a video game, your annoyance would probably increase. A dying man’s need for CPR is unexpected, and therefore pretty much unavoidable – continuing to play a video game is easily avoidable, and clearly shows a lack of consideration for you.

It is this capacity to *avoid* situations that forms a central root of ethical judgements A woman raped by a random intruder in her own home is undoubtedly the complete victim of a terrible crime. A woman who gets raped after getting blind drunk at a frat party and dancing naked on a tabletop presents a more complicated case. Clearly the rape, once under way, cannot be avoided, since it is being violently inflicted – however, situations which increase the likelihood of rape can be avoided.

If someone breaks into my house and takes my wallet at gunpoint, I have every right to be outraged. If, however, I leave my wallet sitting on a park bench for a week, do I have the same right to be outraged when I return to find it gone? Instinctively we feel that this would seem to be less justified.

Clearly, this question of avoidance is central to our moral evaluation of cause and effect. Illnesses that strike without warning, and which cannot be prevented, frighten us far more than those that we can avoid. We can minimise the chances of getting lung cancer by refraining from smoking, just as we can help prevent skin cancer by using sunscreen, and avoid broken bones by eschewing extreme sports. Similarly, we can do much to avoid crime through some fairly simple habits, such as choosing moral companions, avoiding locales and situations where crime is more probable, refraining from substance abuse and so on.

There is a phenomenon known as “death by cop,” wherein suicidal people provoke an altercation with the police, then pretend to reach for a gun in order to get shot. This is an extreme example of pursuing situations where “victimisation” is almost guaranteed. This can also occur in domestic situations, wherein a wife will verbally attack a drunken husband, knowing perfectly well that alcohol inflames his violent temper. In these situations, we can have some sympathy for the man whose wallet is stolen in the park, or the woman who is attacked at the frat party, or the wife who is beaten by her husband – but at the same time, we would have some significant questions regarding their role or complicity in the wrongs they have suffered. To be just, we must differentiate between a man whose wallet is stolen at gunpoint, and a man who leaves his wallet lying around in a public place. Both men have had their wallets stolen, to be sure, but it would scarcely seem reasonable to hold them equally accountable.

Can the UPB framework help us understand, classify and extend these moral standards?
