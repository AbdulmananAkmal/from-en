## Kata pengantar

Dalam banyak dongeng, di sana hidup seekor binatang buas yang luar biasa dengan kekuatan luar biasa, naga atau basilisk, yang menghias tanah di sekitarnya. Penduduk desa setempat gemetar sebelum monster ini; mereka mengorbankan hewan mereka, membayar uang dan darah dengan harapan bisa memenuhi impuls pembunuhnya.

Most people cower under the shadow of this beast, calling their fear “prudence,” but a few – drunk perhaps on courage or foolhardiness – decide to fight. Year after year, decade after decade, wave after wave of hopeful champions try to match their strength, virtue and cunning against this terrible tyrant.

Try – and fail.

Binatang itu selalu abadi, sehingga penduduk desa tidak bisa berharap waktu untuk membebaskan mereka dari lalim mereka. Binatang itu tidak pernah rasional, dan tidak memiliki keinginan untuk berdagang, jadi tidak ada negosiasi yang mungkin dilakukan.

Harapan hanya penduduk desa yang putus asa adalah agar seorang pria muncul yang bisa mengalahkan binatang itu.

Inevitably, a man steps forward who strikes everyone as utterly incongruous. He is a stable boy, a shoemaker’s son, a baker’s apprentice – or sometimes, just a vagabond.

This book is the story of my personal assault on just such a beast.

This “beast” is the belief that it is impossible to define an objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical system. This “beast” is the illusion that morality must forever be lost in the irrational swamps of gods and governments, enforced for merely pragmatic reasons, but forever lacking logical justification and clear definition. This “beast” is the fantasy that virtue, our greatest joy, our deepest happiness, must be cast aside by secular grown-ups, and left in the dust to be pawed at, paraded and exploited by politicians and priests – and parents. This “beast” is the superstition that, without the tirades of parents, the bullying of gods or the guns of governments, we cannot be both rational and good.

This beast has brought down many great heroes, from Socrates to Plato to Augustine to Hume to Kant to Rand.

The cost to mankind has been enormous.

Since we have remained unable to define a rational system of universal morality, we have been forced to inflict religious horror stories on our children, or give guns, prisons and armies to a small monopoly of soulless controllers who call themselves “the state.”

Since what we call “ethics” remains subjective and merely *cultural*, we inevitably end up relying on bullying, fear and violence to enforce social rules. Since ethics lack the rational basis of the scientific method, “morality” remains mired in a tribal war of bloody mythologies, each gang fighting tooth and nail for control over people’s allegiance to “virtue.”

Kita tidak bisa hidup tanpa moralitas, tapi kita tidak dapat mendefinisikan moralitas secara obyektif - oleh karena itu kita tetap dikutuk selamanya untuk mengosongkan kehidupan kemunafikan sombong, dominasi sinis atau perbudakan saleh.

Secara intelektual, tidak ada taruhan yang lebih tinggi di dunia. Kegagalan kita untuk mendefinisikan peraturan moral objektif dan rasional telah menghabiskan ratusan juta nyawa manusia, dalam perang agama dan negara.

Dalam banyak hal, taruhannya semakin tinggi.

The increased information flow of the Internet has raised the suspicions of a new generation that what is called “virtue” is nothing more – or less – than the self-serving fairy tales of their hypocritical elders. The pious lies told by those in authority – and the complicity of those who worship them – are clearer now than ever before.

“Truth” has been exposed as manipulation; “virtue” as control; “loyalty” as slavery, and what is called “morality” has been revealed as a ridiculous puppet show designed to trick weak and fearful people into enslaving themselves.

This realisation has given birth to a new generation of nihilists, just as it did in nineteenth century Germany. These extreme relativists reserve their most vitriolic attacks for anyone who claims any form of certainty. This post-modern generation has outgrown the cultural bigotries of their collective histories, but now view *all* truth as mere prejudicial assertion. Like wide-eyed children who have been scarred into cynical “wisdom,” they view all communication as advertising, all claims as propaganda, and all moral exhortations as hypocritical thievery.

Since we have no agreement on a cohesive, objective and rational framework for evaluating moral propositions, “morality” remains mired in mysticism, and its inevitable corollary of violence. Just as, prior to the Enlightenment, religious sects warred endlessly for control over the blades of the aristocracy, so now do competing moral mythologies war for control over the state, and all its machinery of coercion.

Thus morality remains, relative to modern science, just as medieval “astronomy” did to modern astronomy – a realm of imaginary mythology, enforced through storytelling, threats, compulsion and exploitation – which actively bars any real progress towards the truth.

This “beast” of relativistic ethics looms above us, preying on us, justifying taxation, imprisonment, censorship and wars. It enslaves the young in state schools and Sunday pews; it ensnares the poor in the soft gulags of welfare; it enslaves even the unborn in the bottomless wells of national debts.

As I wrote in my previous book, “On Truth: The Tyranny of Illusion,” the most fundamental lie at the centre of unproven ethical theories is that such theories are always presented to children as objective and incontrovertible facts, when in truth they are mere cultural bigotries. The reason that scientists do not need a government or a Vatican is that scientists have an objective methodology for resolving disputes: the scientific method. The reason that language does not need a central authority to guide its evolution is that it relies on the “free market” of accumulated individual preferences for style and utility.

Alasan moralitas modern - dan moralitas sepanjang sejarah - selalu bergantung pada intimidasi anak-anak, dan kemudian mengancam orang dewasa, adalah bahwa kebohongan manipulatif menyamar sebagai sebuah kebenaran yang baik.

The truth is that we need morality; the lie is that gods or governments can rationally define or justly enforce it.

My goal in this book is to define a methodology for validating moral theories that is objective, consistent, clear, rational, empirical – and *true*.

I am fully aware that, at this moment, you will very likely be feeling a rising wave of scepticism. I fully understand that the odds that some guy out there on the Internet – the home world of crazies – has somehow solved the philosophical problem of the ages are not particularly high – in fact, they would be so close to zero as to be virtually indistinguishable from it.

Still, not *quite* zero.

### Ground Rules

Klaim luar biasa membutuhkan bukti yang luar biasa. In taking on this mammoth task – particularly in such a short book – I have set myself some basic ground rules, which are worth going over here.[^1]

1. I fully accept the Humean distinction between “is” and “ought.” Valid moral rules cannot be directly derived from the existence of anything in reality. The fact that human beings in general *prefer* to live, and must successfully interact with reality in order to do so, cannot be the basis for any valid theory of ethics. Some people clearly do not prefer to live, and steadfastly reject reality, so this definition of ethics remains subjective and conditional.
2. Etika tidak dapat didefinisikan secara obyektif sebagai "apa yang baik untuk kelangsungan hidup manusia." Individu tertentu dapat bertahan dengan sangat baik dengan mengincar orang lain, jadi definisi etika ini tidak mengatasi masalah subjektivisme. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. Saya tidak percaya pada "alam yang lebih tinggi" dari Formulir Ideal. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. Ini juga tidak memecahkan masalah subjektivisme, karena apa yang tidak dapat diakses karena alasan dan bukti menurut definisi subjektif.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. Dalam buku ini, saya mulai dari anggapan bahwa tidak ada yang namanya etika, dan membangun kerangka kerja dari sana.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristoteles berpendapat bahwa setiap teori etis yang dapat digunakan untuk membuktikan bahwa pemerkosaan adalah moral pasti ada yang salah dengannya, untuk sedikitnya. Jadi, setelah saya mengembangkan kerangka kerja untuk memvalidasi teori etika, saya menjalankan premis moral yang diterima secara umum ini melalui kerangka itu, untuk melihat apakah mereka benar atau tidak.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Akhirnya, saya percaya bahwa teori apa pun - terutama yang fundamental seperti teori etika - tidak banyak gunanya jika hanya menegaskan apa yang semua orang sudah tahu secara naluriah. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

Saya mempelajari sejarah filsafat di sekolah pascasarjana, dan meraih gelar Master, tapi saya tidak memiliki gelar PhD dalam bidang filsafat. Saya jauh dari intelektual publik. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

Ini adalah ketinggian keberanian untuk menyarankan kepada pembaca bagaimana membaca sebuah buku, namun mengingat tantangan dari tugas di depan kita, saya ingin membuat satu saran kecil sebelum kita memulai.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. Anda mungkin menemukan kesalahan dengan langkah logis atau metafora tertentu, tapi Anda pasti sudah setuju dengan kesimpulan, dan dengan demikian akan lebih mudah untuk membantu memperbaiki rincian daripada menolak teori secara keseluruhan.

Jika tugas saya merespons setiap keberatan yang mungkin terjadi pada setiap langkah linguistik, logis dan empiris, buku ini akan tetap selamanya belum selesai - dan belum dibaca. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

Saya naik ke medan perang yang dipersenjatai dengan baik oleh orang lain.
