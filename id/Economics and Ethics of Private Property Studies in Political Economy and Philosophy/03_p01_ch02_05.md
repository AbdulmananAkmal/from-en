Menjadi pengakuan atas pengaruh korup ini terhadap opini publik, maka, negara semakin terlibat dalam kebijakan redistributif. Porsi belanja pemerintah untuk belanja sipil dengan. The latter expenditures can still increase steadily in absolute terms, and they have indeed done so practically everywhere to this day, but they lose importance everywhere relative to expenditures allocated to redistributionist measures.[^41]

Tergantung pada kondisi tertentu opini publik, kebijakan redistributionist seperti biasanya bersamaan menganggap salah satu dari dua bentuk dan sering, seperti dalam kasus Prusia kedua: Di satu sisi bentuk*Sozialpolitik*, yang disebut reformasi kesejahteraan, yang umumnya melibatkan redistribusi pendapatan dari "kaya" di antara produsen ke "barang tak bergerak", dan di sisi lain kartelisasi bisnis dan peraturan, umumnya menyiratkan redistribusi dari "has-not" produktif atau "tidak- belum-have”untuk mendirikan‘sudah-have.’dengan pengenalan*Sozialpolitik* sebuah seruan dibuat terhadap sentimen egalitarian dan sebagian besar darinya dapat rusak untuk menerima eksploitasi negara dengan imbalan penegakan "keadilan sosial" negara. Dengan diperkenalkannya kebijakan kartelisasi bisnis dan regulasi, satu hal menarik bagi perasaan konservatif, terutama di antara pendirian borjuis, dan dapat dibawa untuk menerima alokasi nonkontrak negara dengan imbalan komitmennya terhadap pelestarian status quo. Sosialisme egalitarian dan konservatisme kemudian berubah menjadi ideologi statistik. Mereka bersaing satu sama lain dalam arti bahwa mereka menganjurkan pola redistribusi yang agak berbeda, namun usaha kompetitif mereka bertemu dan berintegrasi dalam dukungan bersama untuk statisme dan redistribusi statistik.

Penyesuaian struktural kedua yang membantu dalam pengguliran kembali etika properti pribadi adalah perubahan dalam konstitusi negara bagian. In response to the challenge of the private property ethic, states change their constitutions from a monarchic autocracy or an aristocratic oligarchy to the now familiar type of a so-called liberal democracy.[^42] Alih-alih menjadi institusi yang membatasi masuk ke dirinya sendiri dan/atau ke posisi pemerintahan tertentu melalui sistem undang-undang kasta atau kelas, sebuah undang-undang dasar diadopsi yang pada prinsipnya membuka setiap posisi pemerintah kepada setiap orang dan memberikan hak partisipasi dan kompetisi yang sama dan universal. dalam pembuatan kebijakan negara. Everyone—not just the “nobility”—now receives a legal stake in the state, and resistance to its rule tends to reduce accordingly. While exploitation and expropriation may have seemed bad, they seem much less so, mankind being what it is, once one is given the chance to participate in its process, and while the ambitions of potential power-wielders within the general public previously must have been frustrated, now there is an institutionalized outlet for them.

Dengan membayar harga untuk menegakkan undang-undang dasar, negara bagian-bagian opini publik yang substansial secara substansial kehilangan pandangan atas fakta mendasar bahwa tindakan eksploitasi dan pengambilalihan dilakukan dalam semua penampilan dan konsekuensi yang sama tidak peduli bagaimana dan oleh siapa diputuskan dan ditegakkan. It lures them instead into accepting the view that such acts are legitimate as long as one is guaranteed a say over them somewhere along the line and could somehow somewhere participate in the selection of the state-personnel.[^43]

Fungsi demokratisasi yang korup ini sebagai stimulus untuk bangkitnya kekuasaan negara telah digambarkan dengan sangat pengertian oleh Bertrand de Jouvenel:

> Dari otoritas pemerintah keduabelas sampai abad kedelapan belas tumbuh terus menerus. Prosesnya dipahami oleh semua orang yang melihatnya terjadi; Hal itu memicu mereka untuk terus melakukan demonstrasi dan melakukan reaksi kekerasan. Di kemudian hari pertumbuhannya terus berlanjut dengan kecepatan yang dipercepat, dan perpanjangannya membawa perpanjangan perang yang sesuai. Dan sekarang kita tidak lagi mengerti prosesnya, kita tidak lagi protes, kita tidak lagi bereaksi. Perhatian kita adalah hal baru, dimana Power harus berterima kasih pada layar asap yang dibungkusnya sendiri. Dahulu hal itu bisa dilihat, terwujud dalam pribadi raja, yang tidak menyangkal menjadi tuannya, dan pada siapa nafsu manusia dapat dilihat. Kini, bertopeng tidak dikenal, ia mengklaim tidak memiliki keberadaannya sendiri, dan menjadi instrumen instrumen umum dan impersonal. But that is clearly a fiction…. Today as always Power is in the hands of a group of men who control the power house…. Semua yang telah berubah adalah bahwa sekarang telah dibuat mudah bagi penguasa untuk mengubah personil pemegang kekuasaan terkemuka. Dilihat dari satu sudut, ini melemahkan Kekuasaan, karena kehendak yang mengendalikan kehidupan masyarakat bisa, pada kenikmatan masyarakat, digantikan oleh kehendak lain, di mana ia merasa lebih percaya diri. Tapi, dengan membuka prospek Power untuk semua talenta ambisius, pengaturan ini membuat perpanjangan Power menjadi lebih mudah. Under the *ancien régime*, society’s moving spirits, who had, as they knew, no chance of a share of Power, were quick to denounce its smallest encroachment. Sekarang, di sisi lain, ketika semua orang berpotensi menjadi menteri, tidak ada yang peduli untuk menebang kantor yang dia cita-citakan pada suatu hari nanti, atau memasukkan pasir ke mesin yang dia maksud untuk menggunakan dirinya sendiri saat gilirannya tiba. Hence it is that there is in the political circles of a modern society a wide complicity in the extension of Power.[^44]

Dua penyesuaian lainnya yang dibuat oleh negara untuk mengatasi titik terendah popularitasnya dan naik ke ukurannya saat ini berkaitan dengan hubungan antarnegara. Untuk satu hal, seperti yang dijelaskan sebelumnya dan baru disebutkan lagi oleh de Jouvenel, menyatakan bahwa eksploitasi monopolistik cenderung terlibat dalam perang antarnegara. Dengan kekuatan eksploitatif internal mereka lemah, keinginan untuk mengkompensasi kerugian ini oleh ekspansi eksternal meningkat. Namun, keinginan ini frustrasi karena kurangnya dukungan internal. The support is created through a policy of redistribution, industrial regulation, and democratization. (In fact, states that do not adopt these measures are bound to lose in any long-lasting warfare!) It is this support that is used as a springboard for a realization of the state’s expansionist desires.

This newfound support takes advantage of the fact that redistribution, regulation, and democratization imply a greater tangible identification of the population with a specific state and thus almost automatically lead to an increase in protectionist if not open antagonistic attitudes toward “outsiders” and that in particular state-privileged producers are by nature hostile to “foreign” competition. This support is transformed by the state and its intellectual bodyguards into a frenzy of nationalism and provides the intellectual framework for the integration of socialist-egalitarian, conservative, and democratic sentiments.[^45]

Backed by such nationalism, states begin on their expansionist course. For more than a century an almost uninterrupted series of wars and imperialist expeditions set in, each one more brutal and destructive than the previous one, with always greater involvement of the noncombative population, culminating in World War I and II but not ending with this. In the name of the socialist, conservative, or democratic nation, and by means of warfare, states have expanded their territories to sizes compared to which even the Roman Empire appears insignificant, and have actually wiped out or brought under foreign rule a steadily increasing number of culturally distinct nations.[^46]

However, not only external expansion of state power is brought about by the ideology of nationalism. War as the natural outgrowth of nationalism is also the means of strengthening the state’s internal powers of exploitation and expropriation. Each war is also an internal emergency situation, and an emergency requires and seems to justify the acceptance of the state’s increasing its control over its own population. Such increased control gained through the creation of emergencies is reduced during peacetime, but it never sinks back to its pre-war levels. Rather, each successfully ended war (and only successful governments can survive) is used by the government and its intellectuals to propagate the idea that it was only because of nationalistic vigilance and expanded governmental powers that the “foreign aggressors” were crushed and one’s own country saved, and that this successful recipe must then be retained in order to be prepared for the next emergency. Led by the just proven “dominant” nationalism, each successful war ends with the attainment of a new peacetime high of governmental controls and thereby further strengthens a government’s appetite for implementing the next winnable international emergency.[^47]

Each new period of peace means a higher level of governmental interference as compared with the previous one: internally in the form of increased restrictions on the range of choices that private property owners are allowed to make regarding their own property; and externally, as regards foreign relations, in the form of higher trade barriers and of increasingly severe restrictions on population movements (most notably on emigration and immigration). Not the least because it is based on increased discrimination against foreigners and foreign trade, any such peace contains the increased risk of the next international conflict, or pressures the affected governments into negotiating bi- or multilateral interstate-agreements aimed at cartelizing their respective power structures and thereby jointly exploiting and expropriating each other’s populations.[^48]

Finally, the fourth adjustment is made necessary by the other three, and again because of the ongoing process of interstate competition, crises, and warfare. It is less of the state’s own making than are redistribution, democratization, and war-making—just as it is not of its own making that there *is* interstate-competition at all. Rather, in fashionable Hayekian terminology, it is the unintended consequence of the fact that short of one state’s domination of the entire world (which is, of course, every state’s dream!) the continued existence of other states keeps exerting a significant constraint on each state’s size and structure.

Whether intended or unintended, this structural adjustment must also be noted if one wishes to fully understand the development that has led to the present world of statism. It is also only by mentioning this adjustment that the question why it is specifically the *tax*-state that has risen to world dominance is finally answered.

It is easy enough to explain how through a series of nationalistic wars during the nineteenth and twentieth century the states of Western Europe and North America could come to dominate the rest of the world and leave their imprint upon it. Notwithstanding the presently booming cultural relativism, the reason for this is the simple fact that these states were the outgrowth of societies with a superior intellectual tradition—that of Western rationalism—with its central ideas of individual freedom and private property, and that this tradition had laid the foundation for the creation of economic wealth far exceeding that existing anywhere else. Because they parasitically drew on such superior economic wealth, it is not at all surprising that these states were then able to battle all others victoriously.

It is also obvious why with the remarkable exception of a number of Pacific countries most of these defeated and reconstituted non-Western states have to this day utterly failed to significantly improve their international stature or even match that of the Western nation states, and have in particular failed to do so after having reached political independence from Western imperialism. With no endogenous tradition of rationalism and liberalism to speak of, such states naturally felt inclined to imitate or adopt the “victorious” ideological imports of socialism, conservatism, democratism, and nationalism, the very ideologies to which these countries’ intellectual elite had been exposed almost exclusively during their studies at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, London, Paris, Berlin, Harvard, and Columbia. As a matter of course, a brew of such each-and-all statist ideologies, unconstrained by a significant tradition of private property ethic, spells economic disaster, and such a fact more or less rules out any prominent role in international politics.[^49]

Yet what—and it is the answer to this that is somewhat less obvious—if the Western states fight each other? What determines the success in these conflicts, and what is bound to cause defeat?

Naturally, redistribution, democratization, and nationalism cannot be cited again here, for assumedly these states have already adopted such policies in order to regain internal strength and prepare for interstate warfare in the first place. Rather, just as it is the relatively stronger tradition of private property ethic that is responsible for these states’ dominance over the non-Western world, so, *ceteris paribus*, is a relatively more liberal policy responsible for their long run success in the struggle for survival among the Western states themselves. Among them, those states which have adjusted their internal redistributionist policies so as to decrease the importance of a conservatively minded policy of economic regulations relative to that of socialistically inclined policy of taxation tend to outstrip their competitors in the arena of international politics.

Regulations through which states either compel or prohibit certain exchanges between two or more private persons as well as acts of taxation are invasions of private property rights. In pursuing both types of redistributionist policies, the states’ representatives increase their own income at the expense of a corresponding income reduction for someone else. However, while by no means less destructive of productive output than taxation, regulations have the peculiar characteristic of requiring the state’s control over economic resources in order to become enforceable without simultaneously increasing the resources at its disposal. In practice, this is to say that regulations require the state’s command over and expenditure of taxes, yet regulations produce no monetary income for the state but only income in the form of the satisfaction of pure power lust (as when A, for no material gains of his own, outlaws that B and C engage in mutually beneficial trade with each other). On the other hand, taxation and a redistribution of tax revenue according to the principle “from Peter to Paul” increases the economic means at a government’s disposal at least by its own “handling-charge” for the act of redistribution but may produce no other satisfaction (apart from the increased appreciation by the Pauls) than that of actually possessing certain economic resources and being able to expend them according to its own whims.[^50]

Clearly, interstate conflicts and war require economic means, and even more resources the more frequent and longer-lasting such events are. In fact, those states which control more ample economic resources expendable on a war-effort will *ceteris paribus* tend to be victorious. Hence, since a policy of taxation, and taxation without regulation, yields a higher monetary return to the state than a policy of regulation, and of taxation cum regulation, states must willy-nilly move in the direction of a comparatively deregulated economy and a comparatively pure tax-state in order to avoid international defeat.

It is this relative advantage in international politics of the tax-state over the regulatory state that explains the rise of the U.S. to the rank of the world’s foremost imperial power.[^51] It also explains the defeat of such highly regulatory states as Nazi-Germany and Fascist-Italy, the relative weakness of the Soviet Union and its allies as compared to the NATO-alliance, and the recent simultaneous moves toward economic deregulation and increased levels of imperialist aggression of the Reagan and, to a lesser extent, the Thatcher governments.

This concludes my praxeologically informed sociological account of the evolution of the present statist world and the rise, in particular, of the modern tax-state. Based on such an understanding let me end with just a few brief remarks of how it is possible to overcome the tax-state.

It cannot be fought by a simple boycott, as could a private business, because an institution devoted to the business of expropriating and exploiting does not respect the negative verdict revealed by boycotts. It also cannot simply be fought by countering its aggression with defensive violence because the state’s aggression is supported by public opinion. Thus, overcoming it depends on a change in public opinion. The private property ethic—the idea that private property is a just institution and the only means of creating economic prosperity, and the view of the state as an outcast institution that is destructive of wealth formation, must be revived and must again inspire people’s minds and hearts. With the rampant statist ideologies of nationalism, democratism, and redistributionism (of either the socialist or the conservative kind), this may sometimes appear hopeless. However, ideas have changed in the past and can change again in the future. In fact, ideas can change instantaneously.[^52] Moreover, the idea of private property has one decisive attraction: it, and only it, is a true reflection of man’s nature as a rational being.[^53]
