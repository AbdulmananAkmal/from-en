## 介绍

无数个世代，人类生活在一种自我的子宫的自我的无知：世界是平的，太阳，日月星辰围绕着他，示意他祖先从超越死亡的迷雾，雷声众神的愤怒。

从这个自我陶醉的主观解释的子宫中挖掘出来，需要几千年的劳动，并且要付出数百万的生命。把我们的观点从感性经验转化为概念逻辑所需的努力，是令人恐惧，令人振奋，极度迷失方向和极其危险的。理解世界不是我们所感觉到的，或似乎是，而且仍然是我们智慧的最大壮举。事实的真相是在心灵的眼睛里，而不是在肉体上。

世界看起来很平，不是。太阳和月亮看起来大小一样，它们不是。星星好像绕着地球转，而不是。学习真理需要我们从感官之外看到世界 - 这并不意味着拒绝我们的感官，而是密切遵守感官的真实证据，这不是世界是平的，而是物质、能量和物理定律是一致的。当我们放开手中的石头时，它就会倒塌 - 这是感觉的真正证据，而不是地球是固定不动的。世界是不动的想法是一个不正确的假设，与我们感官的直接证据相矛盾，这就是一切都落空了。如果一切都落下，世界就无法固定和不可移动。

这些都是日常的小道理：岩石坠落，烟雾升起，火是热的，太阳和月亮都是圆的。如果我们坚定不移地坚守这些“小真理”，我们就能及时地得到物理学的伟大真理，它为我们提供了如此可怕的知识和力量。

然而，在微小的真理和伟大的真理之间，是蒙蔽我们的幻觉——无论是物理学还是伦理学。

在物理学中，伟大的真理不能与小真理相矛盾。没有“统一的场论”可以有效地抵触我们直接的感觉 - 坠落的岩石或上升的火焰的经验。如果应用它在收银台返回不正确的变化，最伟大的数学理论是无效的。

然而，在历史上，在我们自己的小真理和伟大真理之间，我称之为“空白地带”。 

### “空白区”

我们告诉我们的孩子不要互相攻击，我们认为暴力在抽象上是错误的，作为一般的道德规则。“小实话”是：不要打卡。“伟大的真理”是：暴力是错误的

然而，在我们的头脑中存在着一个被称为“上帝”的想象实体，这个实体被认为是完全合乎道德的。不幸的是，这个实体不断严重地违反了谴责“暴力是错误的”，淹没世界，尽管完全预知他们的“决定”，批准强奸，谋杀，盗窃，打架斗殴等行为，我们会谴责任何个人绝对邪恶。

因此，我们有一个小的真理（不打）和伟大的真理（暴力是错误的），但在中间，我们有这个“空区”，我们的小真理和我们伟大的真理完全相反，被认为是完全真实的。

从历史上看，我们可以看到物理学中同样的不一致。在我们的直接经验中没有完美的圆，但由于对上帝的信仰，所有行星运动都必须是一个“完美的循环” –几百年来延缓天文学的前提。同样，如果一个人转过头来，他也不会相信整个世界围绕着他旋转 - 这是延缓天文学发展的一个前提。同样，如果一个人转动他的头，他就不合理地认为整个世界围绕着他旋转，他会高兴地把这个向前推进，而不仅仅是他自己的“小真理”，而是作为一个伟大的真理或普遍原则。然而，对于大多数人类历史来说，人们相信星星和行星围绕地球旋转，而不是地球旋转。在这里我们可以看到直接经验和普遍原则之间的“空白地带”，完全相反的原则被认为是完全有效的。

神志正常的人不能直接体验上帝。在他的日常生活中，他完全接受那些不能被察觉的东西。不合理的人望而却步他每走一步，生怕一堵无形的墙，可能会限制他的方式。科学的最大抽象性支持他的方法。

相反地，在宗教的“空白地带”，这两个真理和伟大真理的截然相反，被认为是正确的。 就个人而言，一个人认为那些无法被察觉的东西是不存在的 – 在智力上，科学已经反复证明了这一点。然而，在神学的“零空间”中，完全相反的命题是成立的 - 存在着不可感知的公理必须存在。

我们对军队美德的信仰也存在于这个“空白地带”，如果一个私人被雇来谋杀另一个人，我们称他为“雇佣枪”，并谴责他是一个被击中的人。然而，如果这个人穿上一件带丝带的绿色服装，并采取同样的行动，我们就把他当作英雄，并用退休金来奖励他。小事实（我不应该谋杀）完全符合伟大的真理（谋杀是错误的） -然而在中间有一个“空白地带”，在那里，谋杀奇迹般地变成了“贞洁”。

在旧地图，在地图已经完成了他们的探索，已知土地的图纸会褪色成白纸。知识的增长首先需要对未知事物进行划分，然后将已知的原则扩展到未知领域。

The same is true in the realm of morality. 

### The Casualties

Crossing this “null zone” is fraught with peril. The road from the little truths to the great truths is paved with the bones of millions. From the death of Socrates to the torture of early scientists by religious zealots, to the millions who have murdered and died for the black fantasies of fascism and communism, any forward-thrust of human knowledge into the “null zone” is fraught with considerable danger.

Must “crossing the null zone” – or seamlessly uniting the little truths with the great truths – inevitably be so difficult and dangerous? It is an enormous challenge to unite the perceptual with the conceptual in a straight line of logical reasoning – but *must* this progress take thousands of years and oceans of blood?

If we look at the technological and economic progress of mankind, we see more or less a flat line for countless millennia, followed by massive and asymptotic spikes over the past few hundred years. It is inconceivable that some widespread genetic mutation could account for this sudden and enormous acceleration of intellectual consistency and material success. Theories claiming that a certain “snowball effect” came into existence, mysteriously propelled by an accumulation of all the little increments of knowledge that had occurred since the dawn of civilisation, can usually be dismissed out of hand as entirely *ex post facto* explanations, since they have no predictive value.

If we understand that our staggering potential has been available to us for at least tens of thousands of years – and that there is both great profit and great pleasure in exercising it – then it at once becomes clear that we really *do* want to use our amazing minds.

Thus there must be a downward force that has historically acted to crush and enslave the natural liberty of mankind.

In the realm of science, it is not too hard to see the oppressive forces that continually kept our minds in near-primeval ignorance. The combination of superstition in the form of religion, and violence in the form of the aristocracy, threatened rational thinkers with intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and murder. Just as a farmer profits from the low intelligence of his cows, and a slave-owner profits from the fear of his slaves, priests and kings retained their privileges by threatening with death anyone who dared to think.

The simple truth is that “priests” and “kings” were – and are – merely men. The simple truth is that the gods and devils that were supposed to justify their rule never existed.

We have made great strides in understanding the nature and reality of simple human equality, but the sad fact of the matter is that the realm of *morality* is still lost in the “null zone” – in the destructive illusions of the “middle truths.” 

### "Middle Truths"

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

These “middle truths” are the most dangerous illusions of all, because they grant the *appearance* of truth while actually *attacking* the truth.

By providing the illusion that we have found the truth, “middle truths” actually prevent us from gaining the truth. They are the last line of defence for fantasy, predation and exploitation.

Since they are not only irrational, but *anti*-rational, “middle truths” remain endlessly flexible – as long as they serve those in power. For instance, Christianity arose out of the growing fascism of the late Roman Empire partly by lashing out at the “primitive” superstitions of existing theologies. “Forget your old gods, we have a brand new God who is far better!”

“Middle truths” always take the form of a truth, followed by a lie. “Zeus is a pagan superstition” is a true statement, which was openly made by Christian proselytisers. The lie that followed was: “Yahweh is not a pagan superstition, but a real and living God.”

We can personalise this a little bit more with an example that will be familiar to anyone who has ever counselled a dysfunctional friend. “My last boyfriend was a real jerk,” she will say, and you will fervently agree. “My new boyfriend is really *great* though,” she will add, and you will try not to roll your eyes.

It is very hard not to replace one illusion with another.

“The British government is a tyranny!” cried the American revolutionaries in the eighteenth century – and, after evicting the British troops, they then set up their own government and started attacking their own citizens.

“Aristocracy is an unjust abomination!” cried other revolutionaries, who then set up the tyranny of the majority in the form of democracy.

“Middle truths” can also exist in science, and similarly prevent the natural progress from the little truths to the great truths. Until the eighteenth century, for instance, biologists believed in “spontaneous generation,” or the idea that life can spring from nonliving matter. This had never been observed, of course, but conformed to ancient writings both philosophical and religious, and so was accepted as fact. Also, prior to the Einsteinian revolution in 1905, light was believed to move through a fixed and invisible substance called “luminiferous ether,” just as sound waves move through air. No scientist who believed in this theory had any empirical evidence for this “ether,” either personally or scientifically – but it was considered necessary to conform to other observable characteristics.

Religion is also another “middle truth” – one of the most dangerous ones. It is true that we are a unique species in the universe, as far as we know. A giraffe is a taller quadruped, but man is not just a “smarter” primate, but something quite different. The nature of that difference remains largely unknown – the religious explanation of “we are not the same as animals because we have a soul and were created by a God” is just another example of a “middle truth.” It is true that we are very different from animals. It is not true that we were created by a god and have a soul.

Just as some parasites cannot take root until they dislodge the prior parasites, “middle truths” only attack previous illusions *so that they can take their place*. Those who are sceptical of the prior fantasies are drawn towards the new fantasy. Thus does Christianity displace paganism, Marxism displace Christianity, post-modernism displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy, and so on.

Until the great truths are achieved, and united with the little truths, “middle truths” are just a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods – specifically designed to prevent the achievement of the great truths.

And the great truths are always achieved from the little truths.

The world falls because a rock falls. 

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

Biologically, parasitism is a wholly viable survival strategy for many creatures. In the absence of ethical norms, stealing energy and resources from other creatures is perfectly sensible. In general, the most sustainable and stable form of parasitism is *symbiosis*, or mutually beneficial coexistence. Thus the bacteria that inhabit our intestines aid their own survival by helping us digest our food.

However, a virus that renders us continually exhausted, and barely able to keep ourselves alive, can scarcely be called “mutually beneficial.” If we think of our long and grim history of disaster, starvation, war, disease and poverty – and compare it with the astounding material successes of modernity – it is clear that a form of parasitism tyrannised our minds and capacities for millennia. Now that the last few hundred years have shown the power and creativity of the human spirit, we can view our species as an organism that has shaken off a terrible parasite, and sprung from an endless gasping deathbed to perform the most astounding feats of gymnastics.

When we cure ourselves of a disease, we feel better, but the disease does not. From the perspective of the smallpox virus, the smallpox vaccine is genocidal.

In the same way, the parasites that strangle mankind view the liberty of the majority with horror. Since their parasitism frees them from the demands of reality – to earn their daily bread – they inevitably view the freedom of the masses as a form of enslavement for themselves. Thus would a farmer view the “liberation” of his livestock as an utter disaster…

Establishing truth necessarily limits fantasy. Limiting fantasy necessarily limits exploitation. If I can convince you that I am a living man-God, and that the God who birthed me wants you to give me ten percent of your income, or you will be punished for eternity, then I can become exceedingly rich. I am a parasite of illusions, and depend on those illusions for my sustenance as surely as fungus relies on warmth, dampness – and darkness.

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you. 

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

However, when a government agent sends you a letter demanding that you pay him money, you may feel a certain indignity, but you would not relate the story with the same horror and indignation to your friends.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
