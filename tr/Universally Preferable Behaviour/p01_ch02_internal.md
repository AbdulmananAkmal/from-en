## İç Tutarlılık

Eğer bir mimar isem ve ev inşa etmek için bir plan sunduysam, üstesinden gelmem gereken ilk engel evimin inşa edilip edilemeyeceğidir. Eğer tamamen sabun köpüklerinden oluşan bir evle ilgili harika bir plan sunsam, böyle bir ''ev''in ayakta durması mümkün olmayacağı için komisyonu asla geçmem.

Benzer şekilde, eğer bir mühendis köprü için bir plan sunarsa, karşılanması gereken ilk kriter köprünün ayakta durup durmayacağıdır. Uzun ömürlülük, estetik gibi diğer etmenler sadece, köprüye başlamak fiziksel olarak mümkünse uygulanabilir.

Köprünün ayakta durup durmayacağını araştırmadan rastgele ''hesaplamalar'' ve rastgele malzemelerle köprü inşa etmek -aşırı verimsiz olacağından söz etmek gerekmez - mantıksız olur. Since physical laws are consistent and universal, it is relatively easy to figure out whether or not a bridge will stand *before* building it.

There are two ways to determine the viability of the bridge before building it. The first is to look for internal inconsistencies within the premises and calculations that claim to support the viability of the bridge. If there are significant errors in the calculations justifying the weight that the bridge can support, then the bridge will likely be either over-designed, or under-designed. If erroneous mathematical calculations result in a strength of minus fifty tons per square foot at any part of the bridge, then it certainly will not stand – or, if it does, its viability will be only accidental, and not reproducible.

The mathematical calculations supporting the viability of the bridge must thus be internally consistent before any other considerations can be taken into account.

In computer terms, code that does not compile cannot be tested.

This is true in the scientific world as well. Theories are always checked for internal consistency before they are submitted to empirical tests. The reason that internal consistency is so essential is that since theories claim to have value relative to reality, and reality is internally consistent, any theory that is *not* internally consistent cannot have value relative to reality.

Only *after* the internal consistency of the calculations has been established can the degree to which the bridge meets the specifications be reviewed. It is possible to write internally consistent specifications for a tiny bridge built entirely out of balsa wood, but unless the engineer is writing an article for a model rail-roading magazine, his specifications, though consistent, will fail to meet any industrial requirement.

Once we have determined that the bridge will stand, we can then determine whether or not it meets our specific needs, such as supporting the weight of pedestrians versus trains.

In the realm of economics, the same criterion applies. If my economic theory requires that prices go up and down simultaneously, then it cannot be valid, since this is impossible. Once my theory has been checked for internal consistency, I can begin to look for evidence, and/or begin using my theory to make proactive predictions.

Thus, we can see that any theory, to be valid, requires the following:

1. Internal consistency (logic).
2. External consistency (testability).

With this in mind, we can now turn to the core subject of this book.
