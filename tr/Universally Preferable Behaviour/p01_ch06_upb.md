## ETD: Etik veya Estetik?

Genel olarak, *etik* veya *ahlak* uygulanabilir tercihleri nitelerken, *estetik* terimini uygulanamaz tercihlerden bahsederken kullanırız. It is *universally preferable* (i.e. required) to use the scientific method to validate physical theories, but we cannot use force to *inflict* the scientific method on those who do not use it, since *not using the scientific method is not a violent action*. Non-violent actions by their very nature are *avoidable*. Eğer bir fizikçi bilimsel metodu bırakıp onun yerine tarot kartlarına danışmaya başlarsa, tercihlerini şiddet kullanmadan bana yansıtıyorsa, onu görmezden gelebilirim. Öte yandan bir tecavüzcü, kurbanına tercihlerini şiddetle uyguluyor.

İlk olarak ETD'nin etik alanına odaklanmamıza rağmen, ETD şuan "genel terim" olarak görülebilir ve şu dalları içerir:

- Bilimsel metot
- Mantık
- Deneycilik
- Tartışma
- Dil
- Etik

Ethics is the subset of UPB which deals with *inflicted* behaviour, or the use of violence. Any theory that justifies or denies the use of violence is a *moral* theory, and is subject to the requirements of logical consistency and empirical evidence.

Etik ve estetik arasında daha fazla ayrım yapabilmek için şu üç eyleme bakalım. İlk eylem *mantıksızlık*; ikincisi, *yalan söylemek*; üçüncüsü ise *cinayet*.[^9]

### Mantıksızlık

Diyelim ki, sen ve ben Tanrının varlığı hakkında tartışıyoruz. Ben argümanlarımı ileri sunduktan sonra sen kulaklarını ellerinle kapatıp Tanrı sana var olduğunu söylüyor dersen, sunduğum bütün argümanlar anlamını kaybeder. Açıkçası, verdiğin yanıt benim pozisyonuma karşı mantıksız. However annoying I might find your behaviour, though, it would scarcely seem reasonable for me to vent my frustration by pulling out a gun and shooting you. I believe that it is *universally preferable* to use logic and evidence rather than rely on voices in our heads, but this universal preference is not reasonably enforceable in the *physical* sense, through violence or the threat thereof.

### Yalan Söylemek

Let’s say that you and I set the rules for a debate, and we both agree to judge the question of the existence of God according to reason and evidence. If, as the debate continues, you fall back to a position of blind faith, and reject my arguments *despite* their rationality and evidence, you are not keeping your word. In other words, you were lying when you said that the question would be decided by reason and evidence.

The difference between these two situations (irrationality versus lying) is the difference between a contractual and a non-contractual arrangement. If I hand you one hundred dollars and then walk away, I cannot justly come up to you in a year and say that you now owe me one hundred dollars, because it was a loan. If, on the other hand, you agree to pay me back the money in a year, and then fail to do so, that is quite a different situation.

In the example of “lying,” although you have clearly broken your word, and wasted my time, it would not seem to be either moral or reasonable for me to pull out a gun and shoot you.

A reasonable moral theory should be able to explain why this is the case.

### Cinayet

Eğer bana doğru bıçağını doğrultup koşarsan, çok az insan kendimi koruma hakkıma itiraz eder. Eğer seni vurmak kendi güvenliğimi sağlamak için tek yolsa, bu genel olarak üzücü bir gereklilik olarak kabul edilir.

### Requirements For Ethics

Certain preconditions must exist, or be accepted, in order for ethical judgements or theories to have any validity or applicability. Clearly, choice and personal responsibility must both be accepted as axioms. If a rock comes bouncing down a hill and crashes into your car, we do not hold the rock morally responsible, since it has no consciousness, cannot choose, and therefore cannot possess personal responsibility. If the rock dislodged simply as a result of time and geology, then no one is responsible for the resulting harm to your car. If, however, you saw me push the rock out of its position, you would not blame the rock, but rather me. To add a further complication, if it turns out that I dislodged the rock because another man forced me to at gunpoint, you would be far more likely to blame the gun-toting initiator of the situation rather than me.

As we have discussed above, entering into any debate requires an acceptance of the realities of choice, values and personal responsibility. However, these factors are also present in the choice of the colour of paint for a room, yet we would scarcely say that selecting a hue is a *moral* choice. Thus there must be other criteria which must be present in order for a choice or proposition to be moral.

We all have preferences – from the merely personal (“I like ice cream”) to the socially preferable (“It is good to be on time”) to universal morality (“Thou shalt not murder”).

There is little point writing a book about personal preferences – and we can turn to Ann Landers for a discussion of socially preferable behaviour – here, then, we will focus on the possibility of *Universally Preferable Behaviour*.

### Choice

If I accept your invitation to a dinner party, but find the conversation highly offensive, I can decide to get up and leave – and I can also choose to never accept another invitation from you. This capacity for escape and/or avoidance is an essential characteristic differentiating *aesthetics* from *ethics*.

If, however, when I decide to leave your dinner party, you leap up and chain me to my chair, clearly I no longer have the free choice to leave. This is the moment at which your rudeness becomes overt aggression, and crosses the line from aesthetics to ethics.

If, after vowing monogamy, I cheat on my wife, and she decides to leave me, I have certainly done her wrong, but the wrong that I have done by cheating would be very different from the wrong I would do if I lock her in the basement to prevent her from leaving. We would not generally consider a wife who shoots her husband for infidelity to be acting morally, but we would recognise the regrettable necessity if she had to use violence to escape from her imprisonment. In the first situation, the wife has the free choice and capacity to *leave* her husband, and thus violence would be an unjust response to the situation; in the second situation, her choice to leave her husband has been eliminated through imprisonment. Infidelity does not destroy a partner’s capacity to choose; locking her in the basement does.

### Avoidance

If you and I are both standing at the top of a cliff, and I turn to you and say, “Stand in front of me, so I can push you off the cliff,” what would your response be? If you do voluntarily stand in front of me, and I then push you off the cliff, this would more likely be considered a form of suicide on your part, rather than murder on my part. The reason for this is that you can very easily *avoid* being pushed off the cliff, simply by refusing to stand in front of me.

Similarly, if I meet you in a bar, and say: “I want you to come back to my place, so I can tie you to the bed and starve you to death,” if you do in fact come back to my place, it is with the reasonable knowledge that your longevity will not be enhanced by your decision. On the other hand, if I slip a “date rape” drug into your drink, and you wake up tied to my bed, it is clear that there is little you could have done to avoid the situation.

This question of *avoidance* is key to differentiating aesthetics from ethics. Aesthetics applies to situations that may be unpleasant, but which do not eliminate your capacity to choose.

#### Avoidance And Initiation

There is a particular issue with avoidance that will come up later in this book, which is worth clearing up here beforehand.

If I live on a high mountaintop five thousand kilometres away from you, and send you an e-mail telling you that if you ever walk in front of my house, I am going to shoot you, it is relatively easy for you to avoid this situation. My threat of force is certainly immoral, but questions would surely be raised if you immediately jumped on a plane, climbed my mountain and slowly strolled in front of my house.

On the other hand, if you live on a dead-end street, and I tell you that if you take that street to get home, I will shoot you, your capacity to avoid this situation becomes significantly limited. You could certainly tunnel into your house, or jump over a bunch of backyard fences, but all of this would be considerably inconvenient.

In a similar manner, if a representative of organised crime comes to my house and threatens to burn it down if I do not pay regular protection money, I can avoid that specific threat by moving to another continent, but that would seem like a rather unjust way to deal with the situation, since I must now initiate action in order to avoid the threat.

For the moment, we can assume that *any* threat of the initiation of violence is immoral, but the question of avoidance – particularly the *degree* of avoidance required – is also important. In general, the more that a threat interferes with the normal course of daily actions, the more egregious it is. If I have to fly to another continent in order to walk in front of your house, that is scarcely an everyday activity. If I am threatened with violence for walking down the only road towards my own home, that is a far worse intrusion upon my liberties. If I have to take specific and unprecedented action to trigger a threat, that is one thing – if I trigger the threat through normal everyday activities, that is quite another. Telling you I will slap you if you stand on your head on the dark side of the moon is scarcely a threat – telling you I will slap you if you *breathe* is.

### Etik, Estetik ve Önlenebilirlik

Diyelim ki sen ve ben belki bir yerde saat altıda buluşmak için anlaştık fakat ben yarım yarım saat geciktim. Tepkiniz ne olurdu? İlk başta biraz rahatsız olabilirsin. Eğer sana, ölmek üzere olan bir insana kalp masajı yaparak hayatını kurtardığım için geciktiğimi söylersem senin rahatsızlığın takdire dönüşür. Öte yandan sana, bilgisayar oyunu oynadığım için geciktiğimi söylersem senin rahatsızlığın muhtemelen gittikçe artardı. A dying man’s need for CPR is unexpected, and therefore pretty much unavoidable – continuing to play a video game is easily avoidable, and clearly shows a lack of consideration for you.

It is this capacity to *avoid* situations that forms a central root of ethical judgements A woman raped by a random intruder in her own home is undoubtedly the complete victim of a terrible crime. Kolej partisinde körkütük sarhoş olmuş bir kadın tecavüze uğrarsa ve masanın üstünde çıplak bir şekilde dans edip kendini sunarsa bu daha karmaşık bir durumdur. Clearly the rape, once under way, cannot be avoided, since it is being violently inflicted – however, situations which increase the likelihood of rape can be avoided.

Eğer birisi evime zorla girip silah zoruyla cüzdanımı alırsa, hakaret etmek için her türlü hakkım olur. Ancak, eğer cüzdanımı parktaki bir bankta 1 hafta bırakırsam geri dönüp bulamadığımda aynı şekilde hakaret etmek hakkım olur mu? İçgüdüsel olarak bunun daha az haklı göründüğünü hissederiz.

Clearly, this question of avoidance is central to our moral evaluation of cause and effect. Illnesses that strike without warning, and which cannot be prevented, frighten us far more than those that we can avoid. We can minimise the chances of getting lung cancer by refraining from smoking, just as we can help prevent skin cancer by using sunscreen, and avoid broken bones by eschewing extreme sports. Similarly, we can do much to avoid crime through some fairly simple habits, such as choosing moral companions, avoiding locales and situations where crime is more probable, refraining from substance abuse and so on.

There is a phenomenon known as “death by cop,” wherein suicidal people provoke an altercation with the police, then pretend to reach for a gun in order to get shot. This is an extreme example of pursuing situations where “victimisation” is almost guaranteed. This can also occur in domestic situations, wherein a wife will verbally attack a drunken husband, knowing perfectly well that alcohol inflames his violent temper. In these situations, we can have some sympathy for the man whose wallet is stolen in the park, or the woman who is attacked at the frat party, or the wife who is beaten by her husband – but at the same time, we would have some significant questions regarding their role or complicity in the wrongs they have suffered. To be just, we must differentiate between a man whose wallet is stolen at gunpoint, and a man who leaves his wallet lying around in a public place. Both men have had their wallets stolen, to be sure, but it would scarcely seem reasonable to hold them equally accountable.

Can the UPB framework help us understand, classify and extend these moral standards?
