## Ek A: Özetle ETD

Below, please find a summation of the core argument for morality.

1. Gerçeklik nesnel ve tutarlıdır.
2. "Mantık", gerçekliğin tutarlılığından türetilmiş objektif ve tutarlı kurallar dizisidir.
3. Mantığa uyan teorilere ''geçerli'' teori denir
4. Deneysel teste uyan teorilere ''kesin'' teori denir
5. Hem geçerli hem de kesin olan teorilere ''gerçek'' denir
6. ''Tercihler'' yaşam, düşünce, dil ve tartışma için gereklidir.
7. Tartışmak, her iki tarafın hem nesnel hem de evrensel ''doğruyu'' ele almasını gerektirir.
8. Böylece çok ağır tartışmalarda evrensel olarak tercih edilen davranışlar (ETD) kullanılır.
9. ETD teorilerinin, mantıksal tutarlılık ve deneysel doğrulama testlerini geçmesi gerekir.
10. ETD'nin alt kümesi olan hiçbir ''ahlak'' teorisi mantıksız veya deneysel kanıtlarla desteklenmiyorsa gerçek olarak kabul edilemez
11. As a subset of UPB, no moral theory can be considered true if it is illogical or unsupported by empirical evidence.
12. Moral theories that are supported by logic and evidence are true. All other moral theories are false.

## Appendix D: Every UPB Debate I've Ever Had...

**UPB Sceptic**: UPB is invalid. **Me**: How do you know? **UPB Sceptic**: It's not proven! **Me**: So “proof” is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, nothing is UPB. **Me**: Isn't the statement "nothing is UPB" UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, that's not what I'm saying at all! I'm saying that UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's false! **Me**: So presenting true arguments is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! **Me**: So there's nothing wrong with false arguments? **UPB Sceptic**: No. **Me**: Then why are you opposing a false argument? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh, it's just my personal preference. I just dislike falsehood. **Me**: So you're arguing for a merely personal preference? **UPB Sceptic**: Sure! **Me**: So why should your personal preference take precedence over mine? I like UPB, you don't – and why bother debating personal preferences at all? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh - because UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why is it invalid? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's self-contradictory! **Me**: So consistency is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! And stop repeating the same points over and over! And go read Kant / Hegel / Hume etc.
