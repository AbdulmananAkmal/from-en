## Parallels

Bilim Devriminden önce, doğal dünyanın merkezindeki bilinçli ve "ahlaki" bir varlık olmaksızın kendini sürdüremeyeceği akla yatkın değildi. The sun rose trailing the chains of a supernatural chariot; the moon was a cold and lonely brother of the sun. Constellations outlined the tales and graves of the gods, and storms stemmed from the rage of demons.

The idea that nature was a self-generating and self-sustaining system was almost unimaginable. The Darwinian revolution, the idea that life was not created, but rather evolved, brought this idea from the material to the biological world.

Before science, at the centre of every complex system lay a virtuous consciousness – without which this system would fly into chaos, and cease to be.

Unfortunately, this “virtuous consciousness” was merely an illusion, to put it most charitably. No such gods existed – all that *did* exist were the pronouncements of priests. Thus what really lay at the centre was the bias of irrational individuals, who had no idea how mad they really were.

We have yet to apply this same illumination to our conceptions of society – but it is now *essential* that we do so.

We consider it essential that, at the centre of society, we place a virtuous entity called “the government.” In the absence of this entity, we consider it axiomatic that society will fly into chaos, and cease to be – just as our ancestors considered that, in the absence of gods, the universe itself would fly into chaos, and cease to be.

Bununla birlikte, "hükümet"in varlığı "tanrı"nın varlığından daha fazla değil.

"Tanrılar" hakkında konuştuğumuz zaman aslında konuştuğumuz şey "rahiplerin fikirleridir."

"Hükümet" hakkında konuştuğumuz zaman, *aslında* konuştuğumuz şey "küçük bir azınlığın zorbalığıdır"

The idea of “spontaneous order,” which is well proven in the realms of physics and biology, remains largely inconceivable to us in the realm of society.

However, “governments” are no more needed for the organisation and continuance of society than “gods” are required for the organisation and continuance of the universe.

In fact, just as religions impeded the progress of science, so do governments impede the progress of society. Just as the illusions of *religion* caused the deaths of hundreds of millions of people throughout history, so have the illusions of *government*.

Just as the false ethics of religions “justify” all manners of abuse, corruption and violence, so do the false ethics of governments. When we choose to live by fantasy, we inevitably choose destruction, in one form or another.

When we choose to run society according to religious moral mythologies, we end up with wars, violence, repression, abuse, corruption and bottomless hypocrisy.

When we choose to run society according to *statist* moral mythologies, the results are no different.

We can either choose virtue or compulsion.

Biz her ikisini de yapamayız.

### Çözümler

Devletin hem lüzumlu hem de ahlaki bir kurum olduğuna inanmayı seçebiliriz. We can choose to believe that, without government, society will collapse into “anarchy,” and the world will dissolve into a war of all against all. We can choose to believe that without the government, there will be no roads, no education, no healthcare, no old-age pensions, no libraries, no protection of property and so on.

Similar superstitions, of course, have retarded the progress of mankind throughout history. The most significant precursor to what UPB reveals about the government is what science revealed about religion.

As science began to practically postulate a universe that could run without a god, all manner of hysterics clamoured that the end of the world was nigh, that society would collapse into “anarchy,” and that civilisation would dissolve into a war of all against all.

Any time a system that justifies power can be conceived of running *without* that power, all those who profit from the manipulation of that power cry out that without them, all is lost.

Priests did this during the onset of the scientific revolution. Tanrı olmadan, hayatın bir anlamı yoktur. Tanrı olmadan, insanların ahlakı yoktur. Tanrı olmadan, ruhlarımız kurtulamaz. Tanrı olmadan, dünya kaos ve kötülüğe düşer.

Tabii ki, hiç birisi gerçek olmamıştır. Aslında, oldukça *tersi* gerçek oldu. The end of religion as the dominant world-view paved the way for the separation of church and state, the end of the aristocracy, the rise of the free market, the establishment of many human liberties in significant areas of the world.

Tanrının çöküşü insanoğlunun yükselişi oldu.

In the same way, when we begin see society as the early scientists saw the universe – as a self-sustaining system without the need for an imaginary central authority – then we can truly begin to perceive the possibilities of freedom for mankind.

The establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in society perpetually retards the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, of virtue, of physical and mental health – just as the establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in the *universe* perpetually retarded the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, and science.

The way to oppose imaginary entities is with relentless truth. The way to oppose God is with reason, evidence and science.

The way to oppose the state – the most dangerous imaginary entity – is with reason, evidence and science.

### Gelecek

Whether we like it or not, UPB applies to everything that we do. Human beings have a natural tendency towards consistency, since we are beings with a rational consciousness, inhabiting a consistent and rational universe. Thus whatever premises we accept in our lives tend to compel more and more consistent behaviour throughout our lives – and throughout the “life” of our culture or nation as well.

Thus a man who believes that bullying is a good way to get what he wants tends to bully more and more over the course of his lifetime. Şiddetin iyi olduğuna inanan biri gitgide hiddet dolu olmaya yatkındır.

Diğer bir deyişle, UPB tutarsızlık içinde bile tutarlılık ister. UPB ölümsüzlük içinde bile istikrar talep eder.

The root moral premises of a culture thus dictate its inevitable future. Baskı üzerine inşa edilmiş kültür her zaman daha zorlayıcı hale gelecektir. Özgürlük mantığı üzerine kurulmuş bir kültür her zaman daha az zorlayıcı hale gelecektir.

Bu, ahlaki kurallar için bir mantık çerçevesini resmetmenin önemli olma sebebidir.

İnandığımız şey dönüştüğümüz şeydir.

Eğer yalanlara inanırsak, köle oluruz.
