## Evrensel olarak tercih edilen hareketin değeri

Bu yeni teori sadece belirgin olana işaret ederse eğer daha az değer taşır. If physics only provided an accurate description of how we catch a ball, then physics would not be a very worthwhile pursuit, because we already *can* catch a ball. Discovering that the world is round only aids in long-distance navigation across the sea – it does nothing to help us get down-town Quantum mechanics only becomes useful when other methodologies cannot provide the necessary accuracy – it does not help in building a car.

In the same way, the UPB framework, and the moral rules that it validates or rejects, should ideally provide us with some startling insights about the world that we live in, and our relations to each other.

If all that UPB did was to prove that rape, murder and theft are morally wrong, it would not add much value, since almost no one believes that those things are morally right to begin with.

Bundan dolayı içinde yaşadığımız bu dünyaya bu çerçeveyi adapte edelim ve ondan ne değer çıkıyor görelim.
