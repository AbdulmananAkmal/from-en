### Emtia Parasından Fiat Parasına: Paranın Devrimi

Eğer para emtia parası olarak meydana çıkarsa, bu fiat parası nasıl olabilir? It does so via the development of money substitutes (paper titles to commodity money)—but only fraudulently and only at the price of economic inefficiencies.

Under a commodity money standard such as the gold standard until 1914, money “circulated” on the one hand in the form of standardized bars of bullion and gold coins of various denominations trading against each other at essentially fixed ratios according to their weight and fineness. On the other hand, to economize on the cost of storing (safekeeping) and transacting (clearing) money, in a development similar to that of transferable property titles—including stock and bond certificates—as means of facilitating the spatial and temporal exchange of *non*money goods, side by side with money proper also gold certificates—property titles (claims) to specified amounts of gold deposited at specified institutions (banks)—served as a medium of exchange. This coexistence of money proper (gold) and money substitutes (claims to money) affects neither the total supply of money—for any certificate put into circulation an equivalent amount of gold is taken out of circulation (deposited)—nor the interpersonal income and wealth distribution. Yet without a doubt the coexistence of money and money substitutes and the possibility of holding money in either form and in variable combinations of such forms constitutes an added convenience to individual market participants. This is how intrinsically worthless pieces of paper can acquire purchasing power. If and insofar as they represent an unconditional claim to money and if and insofar as no doubt exists that they are valid and may indeed be redeemed at any time, paper tickets are bought and sold *as if* they are genuine money—they are traded against money at par. Once they have thus acquired purchasing power and are then deprived of their character as claims to money (by somehow suspending redeemability), they may continue functioning as money. Mises'in yazdığı gibi:

> Before an economic good begins to function as money it must already possess exchange-value based on some other cause than its monetary function. Ancak, halihazırda işlev gören para, değişim değerinin orijinal kaynağı yok olsa bile değerini koruyabilir.[^9]

However, would self-interested individuals *want* to deprive paper tickets of their character as titles to money? Would they *want* to suspend redeemability and adopt intrinsically worthless pieces of paper as money? Paper money champions like Milton Friedman claim this to be the case, and they typically cite a savings-motive as the reason for the substitution of fiat for commodity money: A gold standard involves social waste in requiring the mining and minting of gold. Considerable resources have to be devoted to the production of money.[^10] With essentially costless paper money instead of gold, such waste would disappear, and resources would be freed up for the production of directly useful producer or consumer goods. It is thus a fiat money’s higher economic efficiency which explains the present world’s universal abandonment of commodity money. But is it so? Is the triumph of fiat money indeed the outcome of some innocuous saving? Is it even conceivable that it could be? Can self-interested individuals really *want* to save as fiat money champions assume that they do?

Somewhat closer scrutiny reveals that this is impossible, and that the institution of fiat money requires the assumption of a very different—not innocuous but sinister—motive: Assume a monetary economy with (at least) one bank and money proper (“outside money” in modern jargon) as well as money substitutes (“inside money”) in circulation. If market participants indeed wanted to save on the resource costs of a commodity money (with the ultimate goal of demonetizing gold and monetizing paper), one would expect that first—as an approximation to this goal—they would want to give up using any outside money (gold). All transactions would have to be carried out with inside money (paper), and all outside money would have to be deposited in a bank and thus taken out of circulation entirely (Otherwise, as long as genuine money was still in circulation, those individuals making use of gold coins would demonstrate unmistakably—through their very actions—that they did *not* want to save on the associated resource costs.)

However, is it possible that money substitutes can thus outcompete and displace genuine money as a medium of exchange? Even many hard money theoreticians have been too quick to admit such a possibility. The reason is that money substitutes are *substitutes* and have one permanent and decisive disadvantage as compared to money proper. Paper notes (claims to money) are redeemable at par only to the extent that a deposit fee has been paid to the depositing institution. Providing safeguarding and clearing services is a costly business, and a deposit fee is the price paid for guarded money. If paper notes are presented for redemption after the date up to which safeguarding fees were paid by the original or previous depositor, the depositing institution would have to impose a redemption charge and such notes would then trade at a discount against genuine money. The disadvantage of money substitutes is that they must be continuously redeposited and re-issued in order to maintain their character as money—their salability at par—and thus that they function as money only temporarily and discontinuously. Only money proper (gold coins) is permanently suited to perform the function as a medium of exchange. Accordingly, far from inside money ever displacing outside money, the use of money substitutes should be expected to be forever severely limited—restricted essentially to the transaction of very large sums of money and the dealings between regular commercial traders—while the overwhelming bulk of the population would employ money proper for most of their purchases or sales, thus demonstrating their preference for *not* wanting to save in the way fancied by Friedman.[^11]

Üstelik, gerçek paralar bir bankada tutulurken yalnızca paranın dolaşımda olduğu argümanının savunması için kabul edilmiş olsa da, fiat para destekçilerinin zorlukları bunlarla kısıtlı kalmaz. Emin olalım ki, onların düşüncesine göre konunun yeterince basit görünmesi: Bütün emtia paralarının bankada boşta kalması. Wouldn’t it be more efficient if all of this idle gold were used instead for purposes of consumption or production—for dentistry or jewelry—while the function of a medium of exchange were assumed by a less expensive—indeed, practically costless—fiat money? Asla.

First, the envisioned demonetization of gold certainly cannot mean that a bank thereby assumes ownership of the entire money stock, while the public gets to keep the notes. No one except the bank owner would agree to that! Hiç kimse *bu* gibi tasarrufları istemez. In fact, this would not be savings at all but an expropriation of the public by and to the sole advantage of the bank. No one could possibly *want* to be expropriated by somebody else. (Yet the expropriation of privately owned commodity money through governments and their central banks is the only method by which commodity money has ever been replaced by fiat money.) Instead, each depositor would want to retain ownership of his deposits and get his gold back.

Then, however, an insurmountable problem arises: Regardless who—the bank or the public—now owns the notes, they represent nothing but irredeemable paper. Formerly, the cost associated with the production of such paper was by no means only that of printing paper tickets, but more importantly that of attracting gold depositors through the provision of safeguarding and clearing services. Now, with irredeemable paper there is nothing worth guarding anymore. The cost of money production falls close to zero, to mere printing costs. Previously, with paper representing claims to gold, the notes had acquired purchasing power. But how can the bank or the public get anyone to accept them now? Would they be bought and sold for nonmoney goods at the formerly established exchange ratios? Belli ki değil. At least not as long as no legal barriers to entry into the note-production business existed; for under competitive conditions of free entry, if the (nonmoney) price paid for paper notes exceeded their production costs, the production of notes would immediately be expanded to the point at which the price of money approached its cost of production. Sonuç yüksek enflasyon olurdu. No one would accept paper money anymore, and a flight into *real values* would set in. The monetary economy would break down completely and society would revert back to a primitive, highly inefficient barter economy. Out of barter then, once again a new (most likely a gold) commodity money would emerge (and the note producers once again, so as to gain acceptability for their notes, would begin backing them by this money). Tasarruf sağlamak için ne yol ama! 

If one is to succeed in replacing commodity money by fiat money, then, an additional requirement must be fulfilled: Free entry into the note-production business must be restricted, and a money *monopoly* must be established. Tek bir kağıt para üreticisi aynı zamanda aşırı enflasyona ve parasal çöküme neden olabilir. However, insofar as he is legally shielded from competition, a monopolist can safely and knowingly restrict the production of his notes and thus assure that they retain their purchasing power. He then presumably would assume the task of *redeeming* old notes at par for new ones, as well as that of again providing safeguarding and clearing services in accepting note deposits in exchange for his issuance of substitutes of notes—demand deposit accounts and checkbook money—against a depositing fee.

Bu duruma gelince, bazı ilişkin sorular ortaya çıktı. Formerly, with commodity money every person was permitted to enter the gold mining and coining business freely—in accordance with the assumption of self-interested, wealth-maximizing actors. In contrast, in order for Friedman’s “fiat money dividend” to come into existence, competition in the field of money production would have to be outlawed and a monopoly erected. Yet how can the existence of a legal monopoly be reconciled with the assumption of self-interest? Is it conceivable that self-interested actors could agree on establishing a fiat money monopoly in the same way as they can naturally agree on participating in the division of labor and on using one and the same commodity as a medium of exchange? If not, does this not demonstrate that the cost associated with such a monopoly must be considered higher than all attending resource cost savings?

Bu soruları aktif tutmak onları yanıtlamaktır. Tekel ve kendi çıkarlarının izinde olan şey uyumlu değildir. To be sure, a reason why someone might want to become the money monopolist exists. After all, by not having to store, guard and redeem a precious commodity, the production costs would be dramatically reduced and the monopolist could thus reap an extra profit. By being legally protected from all future competition, this monopoly profit would immediately become “capitalized” (reflected permanently in an upward valuation of his assets), and on top of his inflated asset values he then would be guaranteed a normal rate of return in the form of interest. Yet to say that such an arrangement would be advantageous to the monopolist is not to say that it would be advantageous to anybody else, and hence that it could arise naturally. In fact, there is no motive for anyone wanting *anyone but himself* to be this monopolist, and accordingly no agreement on the selection of any particular monopolist would be possible. The position of a monopolist can only be arrogated—enforced against the will of all excluded nonmonopolists. By definition, a monopoly creates a distinction between two classes of individuals of different legal quality: between those—privileged—individuals who are permitted to produce money, and those—subordinate—ones who, to the exclusive advantage of the former, are prohibited from doing the same. Such an institution *cannot* be supported in the same voluntary way as the institutions of the division of labor and a commodity money. It is *not*, as they are, the “natural” result of mutually advantageous interactions, but that of an unilaterally advantageous act of expropriation (abrogation). Accordingly, instead of relying for its continued existence on voluntary support and cooperation, a monopoly requires the threat of physical violence.[^12]

Dahası, kendi çıkarlarının ve tekelin uyumsuzluğu, tekel kurulur kurulmaz sona ermez, tekel işlemini sürdürmeye devam ettikçe de sürer. It cannot but operate inefficiently and at the expense of the excluded nonmonopolists. First, under a regime of free competition (free entry), every single producer is under constant pressure to produce whatever he produces at minimum costs, for if he does *not* do so, he invites the risk of being outcompeted by new entrants who produce the product in question at lower costs. Aksine, rekabetten korunmuş bir tekelci böyle bir baskı altında değildir. In fact, since the cost of money production includes the monopolist’s own salary as well as all of his nonmonetary rewards, a monopolist’s “natural” interest is to *raise* his costs. Hence, it should be expected that the cost of a monopolistically provided paper money would very soon, if not from the very outset, *exceed* those associated with a competitively provided commodity money.

Nitekim kâğıt paranın sağladığı tekel fiyatın sürekli artması, birim başına paranın satın alma gücü ve onun kalitesinin devamlı olarak düşecek olması öngörülebilir. Piyasaya yeni girenlerden korunmuş her tekelcinin her zaman fiyatları arttırması ve kaliteyi düşürmesi cazip gelen bir husustur. Bu halen para tekelinin bilhassa sahip olduğu bir gerçektir. Diğer tekelciler ürünlerine olan değişken talep nedeniyle fiyatların yükselme (veya kalite düşüşü) olasılığını dikkate alırken aslında gelir azalışına yol açabilir, bir para tekeli belirli ürünü için olan talebi garanti edebilmesi-ortak değişim aracı-büyük ölçüde esnek olmayacaktır. Aslında, kısa vadeli hiper enflasyon para talebi tamamen ortadan kalktığında, bir para tekeli uygulamada her zaman para fiyatını arttırdığı gibi(satın alma gücünü azaltır) bir de paranın satışını arttırmasından elde edeceği geliri garanti edebileceği bir pozisyondadır. Para üretecek özel yetki ile donatılmış ve kendi çıkar varsayımı altında para arzının hızlı artışı ile bağlantılı olduğu beklenen tekelci banka sosyal refaha hiçbir katkı sağlamayan kağıt paranın arzında kısa süreli bir artış nedeniyle– doğrudan faydalı üretim ve tüketim malları meblağında-fakat sırf enflasyona sebebiyet vermesi(paranın satın alma gücünü düşürmesi), dolaşımda getirilen her bir ek not ile *tekelci* kendi gerçek gelirini arttırabilir. Uygulamada notları sıfır maliyetle işleme sokabilir ve sonra etrafında döner ve *gerçek* varlıkları satın alabilir(tüketim veya üretim malları) veya *gerçek* borçların geri ödenmesinde onları kullanabilir. Banka dışı kamuya ait gerçek varlık azalış gösterecek – düşük satın alma gücüyle daha az mal ve daha fazla para elde ederler. Bununla birlikte tekelcinin gerçek varlığı artacaktır-O daha fazla para dışı mallara sahip olacaktır(ve istediği kadar parayı elde etmiş olacak). Bu koşulda kimin, melekler hariç, para arzının hızlı genişlemesinde ve bu yüzden de paranın sürekli değerinin düşmesinde rol oynamadığı söylenebilir?

Dönüşümü olmayan kağıt para teorisi, Fiat Money’nin modern liderliğini üstlenmemiş şekliyle Milton Friedmen’in yukarıdaki görüşlerinin önemine değinildiği gibi karşılaştırmak öğretici olabilir.

Genç Friedmen paranın menşei sorusuna düzenli bir dikkat göstermezken, yaşlı Friedmen ise bunu tarihi bir olgunun sonucu olarak kabul eder, bütün paraların menşei emtia paralarıdır(ve bütün paralar ambarın emtia parasına olan talebi gibi yerini alır), ve o A. Hayek’in sorunlu fiat para birimleri rekabet önerisi eski Friedrich’i haklı olarak kuşkulandırmıştır.[^13] Bununla birlikte, onun pozitivist yöntemi tarafından yanlış yönlendirilmiş Friedman herhangi bir şekilde paranın menşei *olamayacağı* ve buna göre de Hayek’in önerisinin başarısız olacağı hususunu anlamakta yetersiz kalmıştır.

Burada geliştirilen görüşlerin aksine, onun bütün çalışması süresince Friedman bir fiat para rejimi tarafından yerine konmuş-doğal olarak- dönüşümdeki bir emtia parayı destekler. Şaşırtıcı bir şekilde, bununla birlikte, o bu tezi için kanıta dayalı bir desteği önermez, bütün kuramsal problemleri, ve her ne iddia ya da deneysel gözlem olursa olsun o birçok iddiasıyla *ters düştüğü* anlaşılır. Burada, ilk, Friedman içerdeki para ile dışarıdaki paranın yer değiştirmesindeki temel sınırlamalar farkındadır. Halen eğer dışarıdaki para dolanımdan kalkmıyorsa, nasıl ki, bir kamulaştırma eylemi hariç, kağıt ve bir para arasındaki bağ emtia/mal olarak hizmet vermiş olur mu? Dışarda paranın dolanımda sürekli kullanımı değersiz bir paranın ortaya çıkmasına neden olacağını kanıtlar; ve paranın emtialaşmanın dışına çıkması için gerekli olan kamulaştırma hususu fiat paranın doğal bir olgu *olmadığını* kanıtlayacaktır!

İlginç bir şekilde sorunu açıklamaktan kaçındıktan sonra paraya çevrilebilirliğin askıya nasıl alınmasının doğal veya yeterli olup olmadığı hususunun dikkate alınması mümkün olabilir, Friedman tamamen doğru bir şekilde fiat paranın askıya alınamayacağını ifade eder, yukarıda verilen gerekçelerden dolayı, rekabetçi olarak sunulmuş ancak tekelci olmasını gerektiriyor. Oradan O "fiat para birimi ürünü olduğunu, bir doğal tekelci olduğunu" ileri sürmeye devam eder.[^14] Bununla birlikte, fiat paranın bir tekelci gerektirdiği hususundan, böyle bir tekelci hakkında buradaki herhangi bir şeyin "doğal" bulunduğunu takip etmez ve Friedman herhangi bir tekelcinin kişisel çıkarı olan bireylerin etkileşiminin doğal sonucu olduğunu dikkate almanın nasıl olduğu ile ilgili bir idda ortaya koymaz. Üstelik genç Friedman özellikle klasik politik ekonomi ve onun tekel karşıtı iddialarını karşı cehaletini neredeyse bütünüyle gösterir. eğer birisine bir imtiyaz verecek olursan o onu kullanır aksiyomu, ve bundan ötürü her tekel üreticini yetersiz olacağı neticesi( fiyat ve kalitenin yanı sıra maliyetler açısından). Bu iddiaların ışığında iddia kamu para tekelinin kurulumunu ilk savunan Friedman’ın bölümünü bir nefes kesen toy olarak değerlendirmek ve sonra bu tekelcinin gücünü *kullanmayacağı* beklentisinde olmak gerekir, fakat mümkün olan en düşük seviyede faaliyet yürütmeye ve para arzını yumuşak bir şekilde şişirmeye mal olacaktır( her yıl yüzde 3-5 oranında). Bu bir tekelci olduğun sürece, insanlığın doğasındaki bireysel çıkar temel dönüşümünün yerini almasını garanti eder.

Fiat para birimlerinin onun saf bir dünya düşüncesiyle sahip olduğu geniş tecrübesi 1971’den sonra varlığını göstermiş ve onun merkezi kaynağının gerisine bakarak, neredeyse 40 yıl öncesi tekelci için sağlanan fiat para maliyet tasarrufları iddiası, eski Friedman şaşırtıcı değil fakat bilgisi onun öngörülerini pervasız bir şekilde tersine döndürüp hata yapmasına neden oldu.[^15] Altın emtia para standardının son kalıntılarının iptal edilmesinden bil itibar bir dünya ağı ölçeğinde dramatik bir şekilde artışa sahip enflasyona eğilimleri; gelecekteki para hareketlerinin öngörülebilirliği sert bir şekilde düşüş göstermiş; uzun dönem tahvilleri pazarın genişçe silip süpürmüştür; böyle işlerle bağlantılı yatırım sayısı ve "madeni para" müşavirleri ve kaynakları şiddetle artmıştır; para pazarı fonları ve para biriminin gelecek pazarları gelişmiş ve gerçek kaynakların önemli miktarları dikkate alınmış aksi halde- enflasyonu veya öngörülemezliği olmaksızın- onların en azından veya pekala şimdi sahip olduğu aynı önemi asla üstlenmemesi mevcudiyetini getirmeyecektir; ve son olarak görünen o ki doğrudan kaynakların maliyetleri enflasyona karşı yatırım olarak özel stoklarda biriktirilen altın üretimine tahsis edilmesi ile de artmıştır.[^16] Fakat nasıl bir hüküm Friedman’i bu deneysel kanıttan geri bırakır? In accordance with his own positivist methodology according to which science is prediction and false predictions falsify one’s theory, one should expect that Friedman would finally discard his theory as hopelessly wrong and advocate a return to commodity money. Öyle değil. Rather, in a remarkable display of continued ignorance (or arrogance), he emphatically concludes that none of this evidence should be interpreted as “a plea for a return to a gold standard. On the contrary I regard a return to a gold standard as neither desirable nor feasible.”[^17] Now as then he holds onto the view that the appeal of the gold standard is merely “nonrational, emotional,” and that only a fiat money is “technically efficient.”[^18] According to Friedman, what needs to be done to overcome the obvious shortcomings of the current fiat money regime is find

> some anchor to provide long-term price predictability, some substitute for convertibility into a commodity or, alternatively some device that would make predictability unnecessary. Many possible anchors and devices have been suggested, from monetary growth rules to tabular standards to the separation of the medium of exchange from the unit of account. Henüz, bir görüş birliği sağlanmadı. [^19]

[^11]: Indeed, historically this has been the case: Traditionally, notes have always been widely distrusted, and their acceptability—as compared to that of genuine money such as gold or silver coins—was severely limited.

In order to increase the popularity of money substitutes two complementary measures were actually required: First, the note-issuing depositing institution had to overvalue deposit notes against genuine money by either charging no depositing fee or by even paying interest on deposits. Secondly, because the guarding of money is actually *not* costless and deposited money *cannot* possibly generate an interest return, the bank, in order to cover its otherwise unavoidable losses, had to engage in fractional reserve banking, i.e., it had to issue and bring into circulation new, additional deposit tickets that, while physically indistinguishable from any other notes, were actually not covered by genuine money.

On the ethical and economic status of the practice of fractional-reserve banking see the section, “From Deposit and Loan Banking to Fractional-Reserve Banking: The Devolution of Credit,” below.

[^12]: It might be argued that a monopoly agreement would be possible (conceivable), if the monopolistic bank of issue were owned by—and its profits distributed to—everyone. Wouldn’t everyone, then, not just the monopolist, profit from the savings of substituting paper for gold?

Aslında, böyle bir anlaşma yanıltıcıdır. Joint ownership of the monopoly bank would imply that tradeable stock certificates must be issued and distributed. Ancak kim bilir ne kadar hisse senedi almalı? Banka müşterileri, mevduat büyüklüğüne göre mi? Yet all private holders of notes help save on gold and would want to be included among the bank owners according to the size of their note holdings. Parayla satın alınamayan malların sahipleri ne yapacak? In showing themselves willing to accept paper instead of gold, they, too, play their part in the resource cost savings. But how in the world is one to determine how many shares to award *them* when their contribution consists, as it does, of various quantities of heterogeneous consumer and producer goods? Here, at the very latest it would become impossible to reach agreement.

Moreover, why would any new market participant—any later deposit, note and/or nonmoney good owner *not* initially endowed with bank stock—want to consent to and support this arrangement? Why should he *pay* for banking stock, while it was distributed to the initial wealth owners free of charge, even though he is now involved in resource cost savings just as much as they were then? Such an arrangement would involve a systematic redistribution of income and wealth in favor of all initial wealth owners and at the expense of all later ones. Yet if new additional bank stock were issued for each new deposit, note, or nonmoney good owner, such stock would be worthless from the outset and any bank offering it would be a nonstarter.

In addition, as will be explained below, regardless of how the ownership problem is resolved, the very operation of the bank will—indeed *must*—have effects on the interpersonal income and wealth distribution.

Doğrusu, altın fiyatı yükseldi. At one point it reached $850 per ounce, and for most of the time it has lingered between $300 and $400\. As of this writing the price is $375.

Among the suggestions for an alternative fiat money “anchor” recently considered by Friedman, the “frozen monetary base rule” deserves a brief comment (see Friedman, “Monetary Policy for the 1980s” in *To Promote Prosperity*, John H. Moore, ed. [Stanford: Hoover Institution, 1984]). In one respect this rule represents an advance over his earlier 3 to 5 percent monetary growth rule. His advocacy of the latter rule was based essentially on the erroneous proto-Keynesian notion that money constitutes part of social capital, such that an economy cannot grow by 5 percent unless it is accommodated to do so by a proportional increase in the money supply. In contrast, the frozen monetary base rule indicates a recognition of the old Humean insight that any supply of money is equally optimal or, in Friedman’s own words, that money’s “usefulness to the community as a whole does not depend on how much money there is (Friedman, *Money Mischief*, p. 28). Otherwise, the proposal represents no advance at all, for how in the world can a monopolist be expected to follow a frozen monetary base rule any more than a less stringent 3 to 5 percent growth rule?

Moreover, even if this problem were solved miraculously, this would still not alter the monopoly’s character as an instrument of unilateral expropriation and income and wealth redistribution. The monopolist, apart from offering depositing and clearing services (for which his customers would pay him a fee), would also have to perform the function, for customers and noncustomers alike, of replacing old, worn-out notes—one-to-one and free of charge—with new, identical ones (otherwise, who would want to replace a permanent commodity money by a perishable fiat money?). However, while the costs associated with this task may be low, they are definitely not zero. Accordingly, in order to avoid losses and recoup his expenses, the monopolist cannot but *increase* the monetary base—and hence one would essentially be back at the older monetary growth rule.
