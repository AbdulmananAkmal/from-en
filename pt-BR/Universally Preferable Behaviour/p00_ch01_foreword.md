## Prefácio

Em vários contos de fadas, vive uma fera terrível de poder estupendo, um dragão ou um basilisco, que tiraniza as terras próximas. Os habitantes dos vilarejos próximos tremem perante o som desse monstro; eles sacrificam seus animais, pagam seus tributos, pagam dinheiro e sangue na esperança de acalmar os impulsos assassinos do monstro.

A maioria se acovarda sob a sombra dessa fera, autoproclamando seu medo de “prudência”, mas alguns – bêbados talvez, em coragem ou estupidez – decidem enfrentar o monstro. Ano após ano, década após década, onda após onda de campeões esperançosos tentam equiparar a sua força, virtude e astúcia à do terrível tirano.

Tentam - e falham.

A fera é sempre imortal, então os aldeões não podem esperar que o tempo os livre do seu déspota. O monstro jamais é racional e não tem o menor desejo de proceder em trocas mútuas, portanto nenhuma negociação é possível.

A única esperança dos aldeões desesperados é que um homem capaz de derrotar o monstro apareça.

Inevitavelmente, um homem aparece que parece, na vista de todos, ser completamente atemporal. Ele é um garoto do estábulo, um filho de um sapateiro, um aprendiz de padeiro – as vezes, é só um passante.

Esse livro é a história de meu ataque pessoal em uma fera do tipo.

Essa "fera" é a crença de que é impossível definir um sistema ético objetivo, racional, científico e secular. É a ilusão de que a moralidade deve para sempre ficar perdida entre os pântanos irracionais de deuses e Estados, "imposta" meramente por razões pragmáticas, porém pra sempre sem uma justificação lógica e definições claras. Ela é a fantasia que a virtude, nossa maior alegria, nossa mais profunda felicidade, deve ser posta de lado por adultos seculares e deixada à poeira para ser explorada e apalpada por políticos e padres – e pais. Tal fera é a superstição que, sem as amarras dos pais, o "bullying" de deuses ou as armas do governos, não podemos ser racionais e bons.

Esse monstro derrubou muitos grandes heróis, de Sócrates à Platão, Santo Agostinho à Hume, Kant à Rand.

O custo para a humanidade tem sido enorme.

Desde que havíamos permanecidos incapazes de definir um sistema racional de moralidade universal, nós fomos forçados a infligir histórias religiosas de horror em nossas crianças, ou dar armas, prisões e exércitos para um monopólio de controladores sem alma que se autodenominam “Estado."

Desde que o que chamamos de ética segue subjetivo e meramente *cultural*, nós inevitavelmente terminamos dependendo de "bullying", medo e violência para enforcar regras sociais. Já que a ética é carente de uma base racional como o método científico, “moralidade” permanece presa à uma guerra tribal de mitologias sangrentas, cada gangue lutando piamente pelo controle pela fidelidade das pessoas à “virtude."

Nós não podemos viver sem moralidade, mas não conseguimos definir moralidade objetivamente – portanto permanecemos nessa eterna condenação para vidas vazias, preenchidas apenas por hipocrisia pomposa, dominância cínica e escravidão pífia.

Intelectualmente, não há nada mais importante e decisivo no mundo. Nossa falha em definir regras morais objetivas e racionais custou milhões de vidas humanas, em guerras religiosas e entre Estados.

Em muitos aspectos, a importância está ficando cada vez maior.

O aumento de fluxo de informações causado pela internet trouxe suspeita de uma geração que considera que o que chamamos de “virtude” é nada mais - ou menos - que contos de fadas prontos de seus anciãos hipócritas. As mentiras pífias contadas por aqueles em posições de autoridade – e a cumplicidade daqueles que os louvam – são, hoje, mais claras do que nunca.

“Verdades” foram expostas como manipulação; “virtudes” como controle; “lealdade” como escravidão, e o que chamamos de moralidade foi revelado como um ridículo show de marionetes projetado para enganar pessoas fracas e tementes e convence-las à se oferecerem como escravos.

Essa descoberta deu nascimento a uma nova geração de niilistas, assim como ocorreu na Alemanha do século XIX. Esses relativistas extremos reservam seus ataques mais ferozes para aqueles que afirmam qualquer tipo de certeza e objetividade. This post-modern generation has outgrown the cultural bigotries of their collective histories, but now view *all* truth as mere prejudicial assertion. Like wide-eyed children who have been scarred into cynical “wisdom,” they view all communication as advertising, all claims as propaganda, and all moral exhortations as hypocritical thievery.

Since we have no agreement on a cohesive, objective and rational framework for evaluating moral propositions, “morality” remains mired in mysticism, and its inevitable corollary of violence. Just as, prior to the Enlightenment, religious sects warred endlessly for control over the blades of the aristocracy, so now do competing moral mythologies war for control over the state, and all its machinery of coercion.

Thus morality remains, relative to modern science, just as medieval “astronomy” did to modern astronomy – a realm of imaginary mythology, enforced through storytelling, threats, compulsion and exploitation – which actively bars any real progress towards the truth.

This “beast” of relativistic ethics looms above us, preying on us, justifying taxation, imprisonment, censorship and wars. It enslaves the young in state schools and Sunday pews; it ensnares the poor in the soft gulags of welfare; it enslaves even the unborn in the bottomless wells of national debts.

As I wrote in my previous book, “On Truth: The Tyranny of Illusion,” the most fundamental lie at the centre of unproven ethical theories is that such theories are always presented to children as objective and incontrovertible facts, when in truth they are mere cultural bigotries. The reason that scientists do not need a government or a Vatican is that scientists have an objective methodology for resolving disputes: the scientific method. The reason that language does not need a central authority to guide its evolution is that it relies on the “free market” of accumulated individual preferences for style and utility.

The reason that modern morality – and morality throughout history – has always had to rely first on the bullying of children, and then on the threatening of adults, is that it is a manipulative lie masquerading as a virtuous truth.

The truth is that we need morality; the lie is that gods or governments can rationally define or justly enforce it.

My goal in this book is to define a methodology for validating moral theories that is objective, consistent, clear, rational, empirical – and *true*.

I am fully aware that, at this moment, you will very likely be feeling a rising wave of scepticism. I fully understand that the odds that some guy out there on the Internet – the home world of crazies – has somehow solved the philosophical problem of the ages are not particularly high – in fact, they would be so close to zero as to be virtually indistinguishable from it.

Still, not *quite* zero.

### Ground Rules

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. In taking on this mammoth task – particularly in such a short book – I have set myself some basic ground rules, which are worth going over here.[^1]

1. I fully accept the Humean distinction between “is” and “ought.” Valid moral rules cannot be directly derived from the existence of anything in reality. The fact that human beings in general *prefer* to live, and must successfully interact with reality in order to do so, cannot be the basis for any valid theory of ethics. Some people clearly do not prefer to live, and steadfastly reject reality, so this definition of ethics remains subjective and conditional.
2. Ethics cannot be objectively defined as “that which is good for man’s survival.” Certain individuals can survive very well by preying on others, so this definition of ethics does not overcome the problem of subjectivism. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. I do not believe in any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. This also does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since that which is inaccessible to reason and evidence is by definition subjective.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. In this book, I start from the assumption that there is no such thing as ethics, and build a framework from there.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristotle argued that any ethical theory that can be used to prove that rape is moral must have something wrong with it, to say the least. Thus, after I have developed a framework for validating ethical theories, I run these generally accepted moral premises through that framework, to see whether or not they hold true.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Finally, I believe that any theory – especially one as fundamental as a theory of ethics – does little good if it merely confirms what everybody already knows instinctively. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

I studied the history of philosophy in graduate school, and hold a Masters degree, but I do not have a PhD in philosophy. I am far from a publicly recognised intellectual. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

It is the height of audacity to suggest to readers how to read a book, but given the challenges of the task before us, I would like to make one small suggestion before we embark.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. You might find fault with a particular logical step or metaphor, but you would already agree with the conclusion, and thus would be more prone to help correct the details rather than reject the theory as a whole.

If my task were to respond to every possible objection to every linguistic, logical and empirical step, this book would remain forever unfinished – and unread. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

I ride into battle well armed by others.
