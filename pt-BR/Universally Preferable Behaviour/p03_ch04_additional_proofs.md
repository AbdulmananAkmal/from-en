## Provas adicionais

Existem outras provas que podemos trazer à tona sobre a questão do comportamento universalmente preferível.

### A economia de livre mercado

Uma economia de livre mercado é, sem dúvida, o método mais eficiente e produtivo de organizar a produção e o consumo de bens dentro da sociedade. Seu sucesso material é sem igual na história humana, ou ao redor do mundo.

A estrutura do UPB antecipa, valida e explica as razões para o sucesso material de uma economia de livre mercado.

Em teoria, uma economia de livre mercado baseia-se na aplicação universal da teoria dos direitos de propriedade. Em contraste, o comunismo é baseado na explícita rejeição da teoria universal dos direitos de propriedade. Já que provamos acima que os direitos universais de propriedade é a única teoria moral válida, isto explica no nível mais fundamental porque o comunismo é um desastre, enquanto economias de livre mercado são tão materialmente produtivas.

Since human beings *do in fact* have equal rights of property, any social system which rejects this right is doomed to utter failure – just as any bridge planner who rejects the reality of gravity will never be able to build a bridge that stands.

### The Scientific Method

Logic and science are in fact methodologies which exist – along with morality – under the umbrella of UPB. In other words, logic and science are both validated by the framework of UPB.

A central question which needs to be answered is: *why is the scientific method infinitely superior to other “methodologies” of knowledge acquisition, such as mysticism?*

UPB answers this question.

Since any methodology for knowledge acquisition must be universal, consistent, and independent of time and place, the scientific method meets these requirements, while irrational and subjective mysticism is the exact opposite of these requirements.

### Public Education

One central principle of free market economics is that quality only really results from *voluntarism*. Coercion, fundamentally, is inefficient – violence always results in poor quality. The old-style Soviet bakeries never carried good bread; a man who beats his wife will never have a happy marriage.

The initiation of the use of force is always counter to any rational moral theory – it is a specific and explicit violation of UPB. Since public schools are funded through the initiation of the use of force, they are a form of *forced association*, which is a clear violation of the *freedom of association* validated by UPB.

Since force violates the moral requirement of *avoidability* – and a lack of avoidability always breeds poor quality – UPB would help us easily predict that public schools would provide education of low quality.

Furthermore, UPB would also have helped us predict that, as more and more force was used in the realm of public education – as taxes, union compulsions and so on escalated – the quality of the education provided would get worse and worse.

This, of course, was – and is – exactly the case.
