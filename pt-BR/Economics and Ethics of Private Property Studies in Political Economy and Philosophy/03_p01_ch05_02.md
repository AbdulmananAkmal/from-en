#### Juros

Dinheiro também é "neutro" para os juros. No entanto, juros, diferente de dinheiro, é praxiologicamente relacionado ao emprego e o produto social.

Como o dinheiro é o resultado da incerteza, então os juros são resultados da preferência de tempo, que é tão essencial para ação como a incerteza (e, de um modo, será melhor explicado em breve). Na atuação, um ator não somente invariavelmente visa substituir um estado mais satisfatório por um estado menos satisfatório de casos e então demonstra preferência por mais ao invés de por menos bens; ele deve invariavelmente também considerar quando no futuro seus objetivos serão alcançados (por exemplo, o tempo necessário para concluí-los) assim como a duração da utilidade de um bem, e cada ação então também demonstra uma preferência universal por bens mais recentes que mais antigos e de mais duráveis sobre os menos duráveis. Cada ação requer algum tempo para atingir seu objetivo; visto que o homem deve consumir algumas coisas vez ou outra e não pode parar de consumir inteiramente, o tempo é sempre escasso. Assim, *ceteris paribus*, bens recentes ou contemporâneos são, e devem invariavelmente ser, mais valorizados que os futuros ou posteriores.[^11] Na verdade, se o homem não fosse restrito por preferência de tempo e a única restrição operando fosse a de preferir mais sobre menos, ele iria, invariavelmente, escolher aqueles processos de produção que iria gerar uma maior quantidade de saída por entrada, independente do tempo necessário para esses métodos gerarem frutos. Por exemplo, em vez de construir uma rede de pesca primeiro, Crusoé iria começar imediatamente construindo uma traineira, como o método mais eficiente economicamente para pegar peixes. Que ninguém, incluindo Crusoé, age desse jeito fá-lo evidente que o homem não pode porém "valorizar frações de tempo de mesmo tamanho de um jeito diferente de acordo com que eles estejam mais próximos ou mais remotos do instante da decisão do ator."[^12]

Portanto, restringido por preferência de tempo, o homem irá somente trocar um bem contemporâneo por um futuro se ele antecipa o aumento em sua quantidade de bens futuros. A taxa de preferência de tempo, que pode ser diferente de pessoa para pessoa e de um ponto no tempo para o próximo, porém que nunca pode ser qualquer coisa além de positivo para todos, simultaneamente determina a altura do prêmio que os bens presentes impõem sobre os futuros assim como a quantidade de poupança e investimentos. A taxa de juros do mercado está agregada a soma de todas taxas de preferência de tempo de todos os indivíduos, refletindo, assim por dizer, a taxa de preferência de tempo social, equilibrando poupança social (por exemplo, o fornecimento de bens presentes oferecidos pela troca por bens futuros) e o investimento social (por exemplo, a demanda por bens presentes capazes de gerar retornos futuros).

Nenhuma oferta de fundos emprestáveis poderiam existir sem uma reserva anterior, por exemplo, sem a abstenção de alguns possíveis consumos de bens presentes. Além disso, nenhuma demanda por fundos emprestáveis iria existir se ninguém fosse perceber qualquer oportunidade de empregar produtivamente bens presentes (por exemplo, investi-los de forma a produzir uma futura saída que iria exceder a atual entrada). De fato, se todos os bens presentes fossem consumidos e nenhum investido em processos produtivos consumidores de tempo, não haveriam juros ou taxas de preferência de tempo, ou ao invés, a taxa de juros seria infinitamente alta, que fora do Jardim do Éden, seria equivalente a uma vida de subsistência primitiva por encontrar realidade com a nada além das mãos vazias de alguém e com a nada além de um desejo por gratificação instantânea.

Uma oferta de e uma demanda para fundos emprestáveis somente aparece - e isso é uma condição humana - uma vez que é reconhecido que processos produtivos maiores, mais rotunda, indiretos podem gerar uma maior ou melhor saída por entrada que os diretos e curtos;[^13] e isso é possível, através das reservas, para cumular a quantidade de bens presentes necessários para providenciar a todos esses desejos cuja satisfação durante um prolongado período de tempo é considerado mais urgente que o incremento em bem-estar futuro esperado da adoção de um processo produtivo mais consumidor de tempo.[^14]

Desde que esse seja o caso, a formação de capital e o acúmulo irão ser definidos e continuar. Em vez de ser suportado e engajado em um processo de produção gratificante instantaneamente, os fatores originários de produção, terra e trabalho, são suportados por um excesso de produção sobre o consumo e empregados na produção de bens capitais. Esses não possuem valor exceto como produtos intermediários no processo de se tornarem em bens (consumidores) finais. Em outras palavras, o valor deles está no fato que quem quer que seja que processe eles pode usá-los para produzir outros bens capitais mais eficientemente. O excesso no valor (preço) de um bem capital sobre a soma esperada nos fatores originários complementares requeridos para sua produção é devido a essa diferença de tempo e o fato universal da preferência de tempo. É o preço pago por comprar tempo; para se aproximar mais do alcance do objetivo final ao invés de ter que começar do início. Por causa dessa preferência de tempo, o valor da saída final deve exceder a soma gasta em seus fatores de produção (o preço pago pelo bem capital e todos os serviços de trabalho complementares).

Quanto mais baixa taxa de preferência por tempo, logo, mas cedo o processo de formação de capital será definido, e ele irá aumentar a rotunda da estrutura de produção. Qualquer aumento na acumulação de bens capitais e na rotunda da estrutura de produção, por sua vez, aumenta a produtividade marginal do trabalho. Isso leva tanto a um aumento da taxa de emprego e/ou salários, e, em qualquer caso (mesmo se a curva de oferta de trabalho deveria se tornar reversa inclinada com salários aumentados), quanto a um total de salários maiores.[^15] Supplied with an increased amount of capital goods then, a better paid population of wage earners will produce an overall increased—future—social product, raising at last, after that of the employees, also the real incomes of the owners of capital and land. While interest (time preference) thus has a direct praxeological relation to employment and social income, it has nothing whatsoever to do with money. To be sure, in a money economy there also exists a monetary expression for the social rate of time preference. Yet this does not change the fact that interest and money are systematically independent and unrelated, and interest is a “real,” not a monetary phenomenon. In fact, in the never-never land of equilibrium there would be no place for money because the future by definition would be certain and with all uncertainty removed no one would have any need for cash holdings (whose sole purpose it is, cash being neither productive nor consumable, to have one prepared for not yet known purchases at not yet known dates). Time preference and interest, however, cannot be conceived of as disappearing even then. For even in equilibrium the existing capital structure needs to be constantly maintained over time (so as to prevent it from gradually becoming consumed in the even course of an endlessly repeated pattern of productive operations). There can be no such maintenance, however, without ongoing savings and reinvestments: and there can be no such things as these without the expectation of a positive rate of interest. (Indeed, if the rate of interest paid were zero, capital consumption would result, and one would move out of equilibrium.)[^16]

Matters become somewhat more complex under conditions of uncertainty, with money actually in use, but the praxeological independence of money and interest remains fully intact. Under these conditions, man invariably has three instead of two alternatives as to how to allocate his current income. He must not only decide how much to allocate to the purchase of present goods and how much to future goods (i.e., how much to consume and how much to invest), but also how much to keep in cash. There are no other alternatives. Yet while man must at all times make adjustments concerning three margins at once, invariably the outcome is determined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. The consumption/investment proportion is determined by time preference. The source of the demand for cash, on the other hand, is the utility attached to money (i.e., its usefulness in allowing immediate purchases of directly serviceable goods at uncertain future dates). Both factors can vary, independent of one another.

If the supply of money changes, or if the demand for money changes with a given social stock of money, the purchasing power of money will also change. However, aside from causing changes in relative incomes, no such changes in a money unit’s purchasing power would have any effect on overall real income. Incomes in terms of money increase or decrease, yet the purchasing power of money correspondingly falls or rises, leaving real income unchanged. Or, with money incomes unchanged, more or less of it will be held in cash (hoarded), but then the purchasing power of money correspondingly rises or falls, once again leaving the real income purchased with a smaller or larger sum of money unaltered. It is this real income, however, not money as such, to which a man’s time preference schedule is related, and in light of which his effective rate of time preference is determined. Since real income does not change through all these monetary changes, there is no reason to suppose that the rate of time preference will. If, for instance, the Keynesian nightmare of increased hoarding becomes reality and prices generally fall while the purchasing power of money correspondingly rises, this will leave the real investment/consumption proportion entirely unaffected. Unless the time preference schedule is assumed to have changed at the same time, the additional hoards will be drawn from funds that formerly were spent on consumption and from funds that formerly went into investment in the same pre-established proportion, so as to leave real consumption and real investment at precisely their old levels. However, if time-preference is assumed to change concomitantly, then everything is possible. Indeed, if the additional hoards come exclusively from previous consumption spending, an increased demand for money can go hand in hand even with a fall in the rate of interest and increased investment. Yet this is due not to changes in the demand for money but exclusively to a change (a fall) in the time preference schedule.[^17]

#### The Capitalist Process

With the division of labor established and extended to its ultimate limit via the development of a universal medium of exchange, the process of economic development is essentially determined by time preference.

To be sure, there are other factors that are important: the quality and quantity of the population, the endowment with nature-given resources, and the state of technology. Yet of these, the quality of a people is largely beyond anyone’s control and must be taken as a given: the quantity of a population may or may not advance economic development, depending on whether the population is below or above its optimum size for a given-sized territory: and nature-given resources or technological know-how can only have an economic impact if discovered and utilized. To do this, though, there must be prior savings and investment. It is not the availability of resources and technical or scientific knowledge that imposes limits on economic advancement: rather, it is time preference that imposes limits on the exploitation of actually available resources as well as on the utilization of existing knowledge (and also on scientific progress for that matter, insofar as research activities, too, must be supported by saved-up funds).

Thus, the only viable path toward economic growth is through savings and investment, governed as they are by time preference. Ultimately there is no way toward prosperity except through an increase in the per capita quota of invested capital. This is the only way to increase the marginal productivity of labor and only if this is done can future income rise in turn. With real incomes rising, the effective rate of time preference falls (without, however, ever reaching zero or even becoming negative), adding still further increased doses of investment, and setting in motion an upward spiraling process of economic development.

There is no reason to suppose that this process should come to a halt short of reaching the Garden of Eden where all scarcity has disappeared—unless people deliberately choose otherwise and begin to value additional leisure more highly than any further increase in real incomes. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the process of capitalist development would be anything but smooth and that the economy would flexibly adjust not only to all monetary changes but to all changes in the social rate of time preference as well. Of course, so long as the future is uncertain, there will be entrepreneurial errors, losses, and bankruptcies. But no systematic reason exists why this should cause more than temporary disruptions, or why these disruptions should exceed, or drastically fluctuate around, a “natural rate” of business failures.[^18]

Matters become different only if an extra-market institution such as government is introduced. It not only makes involuntary unemployment possible, as explained above: the very existence of an agency that can effectively claim ownership over resources which it has neither homesteaded, produced, nor contractually acquired, also raises the social rate of time preference for homesteaders, producers, and contractors, and hence creates involuntary impoverishment, stagnation, or even regression. It is only through government that mankind can be stopped on its natural course toward a gradual emancipation from scarcity long before ever reaching the point of a voluntarily chosen zero-growth.[^19] And it is in the presence alone of a government, that the capitalist process can possibly take on a cyclical (rather than a smooth) pattern, with busts following booms. Exempt from the rules of private property acquisition and transfer, government naturally desires a monopoly over money and banking and wants nothing better than to engage in fractional reserve (deposit) banking—in nontechnical terms: monopolistic counterfeiting—so as to enrich itself at the expense of others through the much less conspicuous means of fraud rather than through outright confiscation.[^20] Boom and bust cycles are the outcome of fraudulent fractional reserve banking. If and insofar as the newly created counterfeit money enters the economy as additional supplies on the credit market, the rate of interest will have to fall below what it otherwise would have been. Credit must become cheaper. Yet at a lower price more credit is taken, and more resources then are invested in the production of future goods (instead of being used for present consumption) than otherwise would have been. The roundaboutness of the entire production structure is lengthened. In order to complete all investment projects that now are underway, more time is needed than that required to complete those begun before the credit expansion. All the goods which would have been created without credit expansion must be produced; plus those that are newly added. For this to be possible, however, more capital is required. The larger amount of future goods can only be produced successfully if additional savings provide for a fund of means of sustenance sufficiently large to bridge, and carry workers through, the longer waiting time. But, by assumption, no such increase in savings has taken place. The lower interest rate is not the result of a larger supply of capital goods. The social rate of time preference has not changed at all. It is solely the result of counterfeit money entering the economy through the credit market. It follows logically that it must be considered impossible to successfully complete all investment projects underway after a credit expansion due to a systematic lack of real capital. Projects will have to be liquidated so as to shorten the overall production structure and to readjust it to an unchanged rate of social time preference and the corresponding real investment-consumption proportion.[^21]

These cyclical movements can neither be avoided by expecting them (according to the motto “a cycle anticipated is a cycle avoided”): They are the praxeologically necessary consequence of additional counterfeit credit being successfully placed. Once this is the case, a boom-bust cycle is inevitable, regardless of what actors correctly or incorrectly believe or expect. The cycle is induced by a monetary change, but it takes effect in the realm of “real” phenomena and will be a “real” cycle no matter what beliefs people happen to hold.[^22]

Nor can it be realistically expected that the inevitable cyclical movements resulting from an expansion of credit will ever come to a halt: So long as an extra-market institution like government is in control of money, a permanent series of cyclical movements will mark the process of economic development. For through the creation of fraudulent credit, a government can engender a smooth and highly inconspicuous income and wealth redistribution in its own favor. There is no reason (short of angelic assumptions) to suppose that it would ever deliberately stop using this magic wand merely because credit expansion has the “unfortunate” side-effect of business cycles.
