Durch das Erkennen dieses korrupten Einflusses auf die öffentliche Meinung engagieren sich Staaten zunehmend in Umverteilungsmaßnahmen. Der Anteil der staatlichen Ausgaben für die zivilen Ausgaben im Vergleich zu den Militärausgaben und dem reinen Staatsverbrauch steigt. Letztere Ausgaben können in absoluten Zahlen immer noch stetig zunehmen, und das haben sie bis heute praktisch überall getan, aber sie verlieren überall an Bedeutung im Vergleich zu den Ausgaben für umverteilende Maßnahmen.[^41]

Je nach den besonderen Bedingungen der öffentlichen Meinung nehmen solche Umverteilungsmaßnahmen typischerweise gleichzeitig eine von zwei Formen an und häufig, wie im Falle Preußens, beide: Zum einen die Form der *Sozialpolitik*, von so genannten Sozialreformen, die im Allgemeinen eine Einkommensumverteilung von den "Besitzenden" zwischen Produzenten zu den "Habenichtsen" beinhalten, und andererseits die von Kartellierungen und Regulierungen, die im Allgemeinen eine Umverteilung von produktiven "Habenichtsen" implizieren oder "Noch-nicht-habenden" zu den etablierten "bereits vorhandenen". Mit der Einführung einer *Sozialpolitik* wird an egalitäre Empfindungen appelliert und ein wesentlicher Teil davon kann zur Akzeptanz staatlicher Ausbeutung korrumpiert werden, im Gegenzug für die Durchsetzung der "sozialen Gerechtigkeit" durch den Staat. Mit der Einführung einer Politik der Kartellbildung und Regulierung der Wirtschaft wird vor allem im bürgerlichen Establishment auf konservative Gefühle hingewiesen, und es kann dazu gebracht werden, die nichtvertraglichen Mittel des Staates als Gegenleistung anzunehmen für ihr Engagement bei der Erhaltung eines Status Quo. Egalitärer Sozialismus und Konservatismus werden so zu statistischen Ideologien. Sie konkurrieren miteinander in dem Sinne, dass sie für etwas andere Umverteilungsmuster eintreten, aber ihre Wettbewerbsbemühungen konvergieren und sich in gemeinsame Unterstützung für die statistische Umverteilung integrieren.

Die zweite Strukturanpassung, die zur Aufhebung der Privateigentumsethik beiträgt, ist eine Änderung der Verfassungen der Staaten. Als Antwort auf die Herausforderung der Privateigentumsethik ändern Staaten ihre Verfassungen von einer monarchischen Autokratie oder einer aristokratischen Oligarchie zu dem heute bekannten Typ einer sogenannten liberalen Demokratie.[^42] Anstatt eine Institution zu sein, die den Zugang zu sich selbst und/oder zu bestimmten Regierungspositionen durch ein Kasten- oder Klassensystem einschränkt, wird eine Staatsverfassung verabschiedet, die prinzipiell jede Regierungsposition für alle öffnet und gleiche und universelle Mitwirkungs- und Mitwirkungsrechte gewährt in der Herstellung der Staatspolitik. Jeder - nicht nur der "Adel" - erhält jetzt ein legales Interesse am Staat, und der Widerstand gegen seine Herrschaft neigt dazu, sich entsprechend zu reduzieren. Während Ausbeutung und Enteignung vielleicht schlecht erschienen, scheinen sie es viel weniger zu sein, die Menschheit ist, wie sie ist, sobald man die Chance hat, an deren Prozess teilzunehmen, und während die Ambitionen potenzieller Machtträger in der breiten Öffentlichkeit vorher frustriert gewesen sein müssen, gibt es jetzt eine institutionalisiertes Ventil für sie.

Indem der Staat den Preis für die Demokratisierung seiner Verfassung zahlt, korrumpiert er wesentliche Teile der öffentlichen Meinung, indem er allmählich die grundlegende Tatsache aus den Augen verliert, dass ein Akt der Ausbeutung und Enteignung in allen Erscheinungen und Folgen gleich ist, egal wie und von wem er beschlossen und durchgesetzt wird. Er lockt sie stattdessen dazu, die Ansicht zu akzeptieren, dass solche Handlungen legitim sind, solange man irgendwo entlang der Linie ein Mitspracherecht hat und irgendwie irgendwo an der Auswahl des Staatspersonals teilnehmen könnte.0>3</a></sup>

Diese korrupte Funktion der Demokratisierung als Anreiz für das Wiederaufleben der Staatsmacht wurde von Bertrand de Jouvenel mit großer Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit beschrieben:

> Vom zwölften bis zum achtzehnten Jahrhundert wuchs die staatliche Autorität kontinuierlich. Der Prozess wurde von allen verstanden, die ihn sahen; er rührte sie zu unaufhörlichem Protest und zu gewalttätigen Reaktionen an. In späteren Zeiten hat sich sein Wachstum beschleunigt fortgesetzt, und seine Ausdehnung hat eine entsprechende Ausdehnung des Krieges mit sich gebracht. Und jetzt verstehen wir den Prozess nicht mehr, wir protestieren nicht mehr, wir reagieren nicht mehr. Diese Ruhe von unserer Seite ist eine neue Sache, für die sich die Macht bei der Rauchwand, in die sie sich eingehüllt hat, zu bedanken hat. Formerly it could be seen, manifest in the person of the king, who did not disclaim being the master he was, and in whom human passions were discernible. Now, masked in anonymity, it claims to have no existence of its own, and to be but the impersonal and passionless instrument of the general will. But that is clearly a fiction…. Today as always Power is in the hands of a group of men who control the power house…. All that has changed is that it has now been made easy for the ruled to change the personnel of the leading wielders of Power. Viewed from one angle, this weakens Power, because the wills that control a society’s life can, at the society’s pleasure, be replaced by other wills, in which it feels more confidence. But, by opening the prospect of Power to all the ambitious talents, this arrangement makes the extension of Power much easier. Under the *ancien régime*, society’s moving spirits, who had, as they knew, no chance of a share of Power, were quick to denounce its smallest encroachment. Now, on the other hand, when everyone is potentially a minister, no one is concerned to cut down an office to which he aspires one day himself, or to put sand in a machine which he means to use himself when his turn comes. Hence it is that there is in the political circles of a modern society a wide complicity in the extension of Power.[^44]

The other two adjustments made by the state in order to overcome its lowest point of popularity and rise to its present size have to do with interstate relations. For one thing, as explained earlier and just mentioned again by de Jouvenel, states qua monopolistic exploiters tend to get involved in interstate warfare. With their internal exploitative power weak, the desire to compensate for these losses by external expansion rises. However, this desire is frustrated by a lack of internal support. The support is created through a policy of redistribution, industrial regulation, and democratization. (In fact, states that do not adopt these measures are bound to lose in any long-lasting warfare!) It is this support that is used as a springboard for a realization of the state’s expansionist desires.

This newfound support takes advantage of the fact that redistribution, regulation, and democratization imply a greater tangible identification of the population with a specific state and thus almost automatically lead to an increase in protectionist if not open antagonistic attitudes toward “outsiders” and that in particular state-privileged producers are by nature hostile to “foreign” competition. This support is transformed by the state and its intellectual bodyguards into a frenzy of nationalism and provides the intellectual framework for the integration of socialist-egalitarian, conservative, and democratic sentiments.[^45]

Backed by such nationalism, states begin on their expansionist course. For more than a century an almost uninterrupted series of wars and imperialist expeditions set in, each one more brutal and destructive than the previous one, with always greater involvement of the noncombative population, culminating in World War I and II but not ending with this. In the name of the socialist, conservative, or democratic nation, and by means of warfare, states have expanded their territories to sizes compared to which even the Roman Empire appears insignificant, and have actually wiped out or brought under foreign rule a steadily increasing number of culturally distinct nations.[^46]

However, not only external expansion of state power is brought about by the ideology of nationalism. War as the natural outgrowth of nationalism is also the means of strengthening the state’s internal powers of exploitation and expropriation. Each war is also an internal emergency situation, and an emergency requires and seems to justify the acceptance of the state’s increasing its control over its own population. Such increased control gained through the creation of emergencies is reduced during peacetime, but it never sinks back to its pre-war levels. Rather, each successfully ended war (and only successful governments can survive) is used by the government and its intellectuals to propagate the idea that it was only because of nationalistic vigilance and expanded governmental powers that the “foreign aggressors” were crushed and one’s own country saved, and that this successful recipe must then be retained in order to be prepared for the next emergency. Led by the just proven “dominant” nationalism, each successful war ends with the attainment of a new peacetime high of governmental controls and thereby further strengthens a government’s appetite for implementing the next winnable international emergency.[^47]

Each new period of peace means a higher level of governmental interference as compared with the previous one: internally in the form of increased restrictions on the range of choices that private property owners are allowed to make regarding their own property; and externally, as regards foreign relations, in the form of higher trade barriers and of increasingly severe restrictions on population movements (most notably on emigration and immigration). Not the least because it is based on increased discrimination against foreigners and foreign trade, any such peace contains the increased risk of the next international conflict, or pressures the affected governments into negotiating bi- or multilateral interstate-agreements aimed at cartelizing their respective power structures and thereby jointly exploiting and expropriating each other’s populations.[^48]

Finally, the fourth adjustment is made necessary by the other three, and again because of the ongoing process of interstate competition, crises, and warfare. It is less of the state’s own making than are redistribution, democratization, and war-making—just as it is not of its own making that there *is* interstate-competition at all. Rather, in fashionable Hayekian terminology, it is the unintended consequence of the fact that short of one state’s domination of the entire world (which is, of course, every state’s dream!) the continued existence of other states keeps exerting a significant constraint on each state’s size and structure.

Whether intended or unintended, this structural adjustment must also be noted if one wishes to fully understand the development that has led to the present world of statism. It is also only by mentioning this adjustment that the question why it is specifically the *tax*-state that has risen to world dominance is finally answered.

It is easy enough to explain how through a series of nationalistic wars during the nineteenth and twentieth century the states of Western Europe and North America could come to dominate the rest of the world and leave their imprint upon it. Notwithstanding the presently booming cultural relativism, the reason for this is the simple fact that these states were the outgrowth of societies with a superior intellectual tradition—that of Western rationalism—with its central ideas of individual freedom and private property, and that this tradition had laid the foundation for the creation of economic wealth far exceeding that existing anywhere else. Because they parasitically drew on such superior economic wealth, it is not at all surprising that these states were then able to battle all others victoriously.

It is also obvious why with the remarkable exception of a number of Pacific countries most of these defeated and reconstituted non-Western states have to this day utterly failed to significantly improve their international stature or even match that of the Western nation states, and have in particular failed to do so after having reached political independence from Western imperialism. With no endogenous tradition of rationalism and liberalism to speak of, such states naturally felt inclined to imitate or adopt the “victorious” ideological imports of socialism, conservatism, democratism, and nationalism, the very ideologies to which these countries’ intellectual elite had been exposed almost exclusively during their studies at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, London, Paris, Berlin, Harvard, and Columbia. As a matter of course, a brew of such each-and-all statist ideologies, unconstrained by a significant tradition of private property ethic, spells economic disaster, and such a fact more or less rules out any prominent role in international politics.[^49]

Yet what—and it is the answer to this that is somewhat less obvious—if the Western states fight each other? What determines the success in these conflicts, and what is bound to cause defeat?

Naturally, redistribution, democratization, and nationalism cannot be cited again here, for assumedly these states have already adopted such policies in order to regain internal strength and prepare for interstate warfare in the first place. Rather, just as it is the relatively stronger tradition of private property ethic that is responsible for these states’ dominance over the non-Western world, so, *ceteris paribus*, is a relatively more liberal policy responsible for their long run success in the struggle for survival among the Western states themselves. Among them, those states which have adjusted their internal redistributionist policies so as to decrease the importance of a conservatively minded policy of economic regulations relative to that of socialistically inclined policy of taxation tend to outstrip their competitors in the arena of international politics.

Regulations through which states either compel or prohibit certain exchanges between two or more private persons as well as acts of taxation are invasions of private property rights. In pursuing both types of redistributionist policies, the states’ representatives increase their own income at the expense of a corresponding income reduction for someone else. However, while by no means less destructive of productive output than taxation, regulations have the peculiar characteristic of requiring the state’s control over economic resources in order to become enforceable without simultaneously increasing the resources at its disposal. In practice, this is to say that regulations require the state’s command over and expenditure of taxes, yet regulations produce no monetary income for the state but only income in the form of the satisfaction of pure power lust (as when A, for no material gains of his own, outlaws that B and C engage in mutually beneficial trade with each other). On the other hand, taxation and a redistribution of tax revenue according to the principle “from Peter to Paul” increases the economic means at a government’s disposal at least by its own “handling-charge” for the act of redistribution but may produce no other satisfaction (apart from the increased appreciation by the Pauls) than that of actually possessing certain economic resources and being able to expend them according to its own whims.[^50]

Clearly, interstate conflicts and war require economic means, and even more resources the more frequent and longer-lasting such events are. In fact, those states which control more ample economic resources expendable on a war-effort will *ceteris paribus* tend to be victorious. Hence, since a policy of taxation, and taxation without regulation, yields a higher monetary return to the state than a policy of regulation, and of taxation cum regulation, states must willy-nilly move in the direction of a comparatively deregulated economy and a comparatively pure tax-state in order to avoid international defeat.

It is this relative advantage in international politics of the tax-state over the regulatory state that explains the rise of the U.S. to the rank of the world’s foremost imperial power.[^51] It also explains the defeat of such highly regulatory states as Nazi-Germany and Fascist-Italy, the relative weakness of the Soviet Union and its allies as compared to the NATO-alliance, and the recent simultaneous moves toward economic deregulation and increased levels of imperialist aggression of the Reagan and, to a lesser extent, the Thatcher governments.

This concludes my praxeologically informed sociological account of the evolution of the present statist world and the rise, in particular, of the modern tax-state. Based on such an understanding let me end with just a few brief remarks of how it is possible to overcome the tax-state.

It cannot be fought by a simple boycott, as could a private business, because an institution devoted to the business of expropriating and exploiting does not respect the negative verdict revealed by boycotts. It also cannot simply be fought by countering its aggression with defensive violence because the state’s aggression is supported by public opinion. Thus, overcoming it depends on a change in public opinion. The private property ethic—the idea that private property is a just institution and the only means of creating economic prosperity, and the view of the state as an outcast institution that is destructive of wealth formation, must be revived and must again inspire people’s minds and hearts. With the rampant statist ideologies of nationalism, democratism, and redistributionism (of either the socialist or the conservative kind), this may sometimes appear hopeless. However, ideas have changed in the past and can change again in the future. In fact, ideas can change instantaneously.[^52] Moreover, the idea of private property has one decisive attraction: it, and only it, is a true reflection of man’s nature as a rational being.[^53]
