But the public goods theory breaks down not only because of the faulty moral reasoning implied in it. Even the utilitarian, economic reasoning contained in the above argument is blatantly wrong. As the public goods theory states, it might well be that it would be better to have the public goods than not to have them, though it should not be forgotten that no a priori reason exists that this must be so of necessity (which would then end the public goods theorists’ reasoning right here). For it is clearly possible, and indeed known to be a fact, that anarchists exist who so greatly abhor state action that they would prefer not having the so-called public goods at all to having them provided by the state.[^16] In any case, even if the argument is conceded so far, to leap from the statement that the public goods are desirable to the statement that they should therefore be provided by the state is anything but conclusive, as this is by no means the choice with which one is confronted. Since money or other resources must be withdrawn from possible alternative uses to finance the supposedly desirable public goods, the only relevant and appropriate question is whether or not these alternative uses to which the money could be put (that is, the private goods which could have been acquired but now cannot be bought because the money is being spent on public goods instead) are more valuable—more urgent—than the public goods. And the answer to this question is perfectly clear. In terms of consumer evaluations, however high its absolute level might be, the value of the public goods is relatively lower than that of the competing private goods because if one had left the choice to the consumers (and had not forced one alternative upon them), they evidently would have preferred spending their money differently (otherwise no force would have been necessary). This proves beyond any doubt that the resources used for the provision of public goods are wasted because they provide consumers with goods or services that at best are only of secondary importance. In short, even if one assumed that public goods that can be distinguished clearly from private goods existed, and even if it were granted that a given public good might be useful, public goods would still compete with private goods. And there is only one method for finding out whether or not they are more urgently desired and to what extent, or *mutatis mutandis*, if, and to what extent, their production would take place at the expense of the nonproduction or reduced production of more urgently needed private goods: by having everything provided by freely competing private enterprises. Hence, contrary to the conclusion arrived at by the public goods theorists, logic forces one to accept the result that only a pure market system can safeguard the rationality, from the point of view of the consumers, of a decision to produce a public good. And only under a pure capitalist order could it be ensured that the decision about how much of a public good to produce (provided it should be produced at all) would be rational as well.[^17] No less than a semantic revolution of truly Orwellian dimensions would be required to come up with a different result. Only if one were willing to interpret someone’s ”no” as really meaning “yes,” the “nonbuying of something” as meaning that it is really “preferred over that which the nonbuying person does instead of nonbuying,” of “force” really meaning “freedom,” of “noncontracting” really meaning “making a contract” and so on, could the public goods theorists’ point be “proven.”[^18] But how then could we be sure that they really mean what they seem to mean when they say what they say, and do not rather mean the exact opposite, or do not mean anything with a definite content at all, but are simply babbling? We could not. Murray N. Rothbard is thus completely right when he comments on the endeavors of the public goods ideologues to prove the existence of so-called market failures due to the nonproduction or a quantitatively or qualitatively “deficient” production of public goods. He writes,


[^16]: See on this argument Rothbard, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” p. 533\. Incidentally, the existence of one single anarchist also invalidates all references to Pareto optimality as a criterion for economically legitimate state action.

[^17]: Essentially the same reasoning that leads one to reject the socialist-statist theory built on the allegedly unique character of public goods as defined by the criterion of nonexcludability, also applies when, instead, such goods are defined by means of the criterion of nonrivalrous consumption (see notes 6 and 12 above). For one thing, in order to derive the normative statement that they *should* be so offered from the statement of fact that goods that allow nonrivalrous consumption *would not* be offered on the free market to as many consumers as could be, this theory would face exactly the same problem of requiring a justifiable ethics. Moreover, the utilitarian reasoning is blatantly wrong, too. To reason, as the public goods theorists do, that the free-market practice of excluding free riders from the enjoyment of goods that would permit nonrivalrous consumption at zero marginal costs would indicate a suboptimal level of social welfare and hence would require compensatory state action is faulty on two related counts. First, cost is a subjective category and can never be objectively measured by any outside observer. Hence, to say that additional free riders could be admitted at no cost is totally inadmissible. In fact, if the subjective costs of admitting more consumers at no charge were indeed zero, the private owner-producer of the good in question would do so. If he does not do so, this reveals that the costs for him are *not* zero. The reason may be his belief that to do so would reduce the satisfaction available to the other consumers and so would tend to depress the price for his product; or it may simply be his dislike for uninvited free riders as, for instance, when I object to the proposal that I turn over my less-thancapacity-filled living room to various self-inviting guests for nonrivalrous consumption. In any case, since for whatever reason the cost cannot be assumed to be zero, it is then fallacious to speak of a market failure when certain goods are not handed out free of charge. On the other hand, welfare losses would indeed become unavoidable if one accepted the public goods theorists’ recommendation of letting goods that allegedly allow for nonrivalrous consumption to be provided free of charge by the state. Besides the insurmountable task of determining what fulfills this criterion, the state, independent of voluntary consumer purchases as it is, would first off face the equally insoluble problem of rationally determining *how much* of the public good to provide. Clearly, since even public goods are not free goods but are subject to “crowding” at some level of use, there is no stopping point for the state, because at any level of supply there would still be users who would have to be excluded and who, with a larger supply, could enjoy a free ride. But even if this problem could be solved miraculously, in any case the (necessarily inflated) cost of production and operation of the public goods distributed free of charge for nonrivalrous consumption would have to be paid for by taxes. And this then, i.e., the fact that consumers would have been coerced into enjoying their free rides, again proves beyond any doubt that these public goods, too, are of inferior value from the point of view of consumers to the competing private goods that they now no longer can acquire.

[^18]: Cei mai proeminenți campioni moderni ai discuțiilor duble Orwellian sunt Buchanan și Tullock (vezi lucrările lor menționate în nota 3 de mai sus). Ei susțin că guvernul este fondat printr-un "contract constituțional" în care fiecare "este de acord" din punct de vedere conceptual "să se supună puterilor coercitive ale guvernării, înțelegându-se că și ceilalți îi sunt supuși. Prin urmare, guvernul este doar aparent coercitiv, dar într-adevăr voluntar. Există mai multe obiecții evidente față de acest argument ciudat. În primul rând, nu există dovezi empirice care să indice că orice constituție a fost acceptată în mod voluntar de oricine în cauză. Mai rău, însăși ideea că toți oamenii se constrâng voluntar este pur și simplu de neconceput, în același mod în care este de neconceput să negăm legea contradicției. Căci dacă coerciția voluntară acceptată este voluntară, atunci ar trebui să fie posibilă revocarea supunerii față de constituție și statul nu ar fi altceva decât un club voluntar alăturat. Dacă, totuși, nu există "dreptul de a ignora statul" - și că nu există acest drept este, desigur, semnul caracteristic al unui stat în raport cu un club - atunci ar fi logic inadmisibil să se pretindă că acceptarea constrângerii de către stat este voluntară. În plus, chiar dacă toate acestea ar fi fost posibile, contactul constituțional nu putea încă să pretindă că leagă pe nimeni, cu excepția semnatarilor originari ai constituției.

   Cum poate Buchanan și Tullock să vină cu idei atât de absurde? Printr-un truc semantic. Ceea ce a fost "de neconceput" și "fără înțelegere" în vorbirea pre-Orwellian este pentru ei "conceptual posibil" și un "acord conceptual." Pentru un exercițiu foarte instructiv de scurtă durată în acest fel de raționament în salturi, vezi James Buchanan, O perspectivă contractantă asupra anarhiei ", în idem, * Libertatea în contractul constituțional * (Colegiul: Texas A & M University Press, 1977). Aici aflăm că ,chiar și acceptarea limitei de viteză de 55 mph este posibilă (Buchanan nu este destul de sigur), deoarece în cele din urmă se bazează pe faptul că ne convenim în mod conceptual asupra constituției și că Buchanan nu este într-adevăr statist , dar, de fapt, un anarhist (p. 11). 

> [o] vedere complet științific economică sustine că acțiunea pe piața liberă este întotdeauna optimă. Este optimă, nu din punctul de vedere al viziunilor etice personale ale unui economist, ci din punctul de vedere al acțiunilor libere, voluntare ale tuturor participanților și al satisfacerii nevoilor exprimate liber de consumatori. Interferențele guvernamentale, prin urmare, se vor îndepărta neapărat și întotdeauna de la un astfel de optim.[^19]

[^ 19]: Rothbard, om, economie și stat, p. 887.

Într-adevăr, argumentele despre care se presupune că demonstrează eșecurile pieței nu sunt cu nimic absurde. Scapate de deghizarea lor de jargon tehnic toate acestea se dovedesc a fi: O piață nu este perfectă, deoarece se caracterizează prin principiul fără agresiune  impus de condițiile marcate de deficit, și astfel anumite bunuri sau servicii care ar putea fi produse și furnizate numai dacă agresiunea ar fi acceptată nu va fi produsă. Destul de adevărat, dar nici un teoretician de piață n-ar îndrăzni vreodată să nege acest lucru. Totuși, și acest lucru este decisivă, această "imperfecțiune" a pieței poate fi apărată atât moral, cât și economic, în timp ce presupusele "perfecții" ale piețelor propagate de teoreticienii de bunuri publice nu pot. [^20] De asemenea, este adevărat că încetarea practicii actuale a statului de a furniza bunuri publice ar presupune o schimbare în structura socială existentă și distribuirea bogăției. O astfel de remaniere ar însemna cu siguranță dificultăți pentru unii oameni. De fapt, tocmai de aceea există o rezistență publică larg răspândită la o politică de privatizare a funcțiilor statului, chiar dacă, pe termen lung, bogăția socială globală ar fi sporită de această politică. Cu toate acestea, acest fapt nu poate fi acceptat ca un argument valid care demonstrează eșecul piețelor. Dacă unui om i sa permis să lovească alți oameni în cap și acum nu i se permite să continue această practică, el este cu siguranță e rănit. Dar s-ar accepta cu greu acest lucru ca o scuză valabilă pentru susținerea vechilor reguli. El este rănit, dar rănindu-l înseamnă înlocuirea unei ordini sociale în care fiecare consumator are dreptul egal de a determina ce și de ce este produs, de un sistem în care unii consumatori au dreptul de a determina în ce măsură ceilalți consumatori nu au permis să cumpere în mod voluntar ceea ce doresc cu mijloacele pe care le-au dobândit cu adevărat și la dispoziția lor. Cu siguranță, o astfel de substituire ar fi preferabilă din punctul de vedere al tuturor consumatorilor ca și consumatori voluntari.

[^20]: Acest lucru, în primul rând, ar trebui ținut minte ori de câte ori cineva trebuie să evalueze valabilitatea argumentelor statist-intervenționiste, cum ar fi următoarele, de John Maynard Keynes ("The End of Laissez Faire", în idem, Scrieri, Londra: Macmillan, 1972, voi IX, p. 291):

    > Cea mai importantă agendă a statului nu se referă la acele activități pe care indivizii le îndeplinesc deja, ci la acele funcții care nu intră în sfera individului, la acele decizii luate de nimeni dacă statul nu le ia. Lucrul important pentru guvern nu este acela de a face lucrurile pe care indivizii le fac deja și de a le face mai bine sau puțin mai rău: ci de a face acele lucruri care nu se fac deloc.

    Acest raționament nu numai * pare * fals, este cu adevărat.

Prin forța raționamentului logic trebuie acceptată concluzia lui Molinari că, din motive de consum, toate bunurile și serviciile sunt furnizate de piețe. [^21] Nu este doar fals că există categorii distincte de mărfuri distincte care ar aduce modificări speciale în teoria generală a necesității superiorității economice a capitalismului; chiar dacă au existat, nu s-a putut identifica un motiv special pentru care aceste bunuri publice pretinse că nu ar trebui să fie produse și de întreprinderi private, deoarece acestea invariabil se află în concurență cu bunurile private. De fapt, în pofida propagandei teoreticienilor de bunuri publice, eficiența mai mare a piețelor în comparație cu statul se realizează din ce în ce mai mult cu privire la tot mai multe bunuri publice pretinse. Confruntat zilnic cu experiență, aproape că nimeni nu studia în mod serios că aceste lucruri ar putea nega faptul că piețele de astăzi ar putea produce servicii poștale, căi ferate, electricitate, telefon, educație, bani, drumuri și așa mai departe decât statul, adică mai mult în favoarea consumatorilor. Cu toate acestea, oamenii, în general, nu vor să accepte într-un anumit sector ce le-a forțat logica: în producerea de securitate. Prin urmare, pentru restul acestui capitol îmi voi îndrepta atenția spre explicarea funcționării superioare a economiei capitaliste în acest domeniu - o superioritate a cărei cauză logică a fost deja făcută până acum, dar care va deveni mai convingătoare odată ce un material empiric este adăugată la analiză și este studiat ca o problemă în sine. [^22] 

[^21]: Some libertarian minarchists object that the existence of a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of a common body of law, and hence a government as a monopolistic judge and enforcement agency. (See, for example, John Hospers, *Libertarianism* [Los Angeles: Nash, 1971]; Tibor Machan, *Human Rights and Human Liberties* [Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1975].) Now it is certainly correct that a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of those rules that underlie its operation. But from this it does not follow that this task must be entrusted to a monopolistic agency. In fact, a common language or sign-system is also presupposed by the market; but one would hardly think it convincing to conclude that hence the government must ensure the observance of the rules of language. Like the system of language, then, the rules of market behavior emerge spontaneously and can be enforced by the “invisible hand” of self-interest. Without the observance of common rules of speech, people could not reap the advantages that communication offers, and without the observance of common rules of conduct, people could not enjoy the benefits of the higher productivity of an exchange economy based on the division of labor. In addition, as I indicated above, independent of any government the nonaggression principle underlying the operation of markets can be defended a priori as just. Moreover, as I will argue in the conclusion of this chapter, it is precisely a competitive system of law-administration and law-enforcement that generates the greatest possible pressure to elaborate and enact rules of conduct that incorporate the highest degree of *consensus* conceivable. And of course the very rules that do just this are those that a priori reasoning establishes as the logically necessary presupposition of argumentation and argumentative agreement.

[^22]: Incidentally, the same logic that would force one to accept the idea of the production of security by private business as economically the best solution to the problem of consumer satisfaction also forces one, so far as moral-ideological positions are concerned, to abandon the political theory of classical liberalism and take the small but nevertheless decisive step (from there) to the theory of libertarianism, or private property anarchism. Classical liberalism, with Ludwig von Mises as its foremost representative in the twentieth century, advocates a social system based on the nonaggression principle. And this is also what libertarianism advocates. But classical liberalism then wants to have this principle enforced by a monopolistic agency (the government, the state)—an organization, that is, which is not exclusively dependent on voluntary, contractual support by the consumers of its respective services, but instead has the right to unilaterally determine its own income, i.e., the taxes to be imposed on consumers in order to do its job in the area of security production. Now, however plausible this might sound, it should be clear that it is inconsistent. Either the principle of nonaggression is valid, in which case the state as a privileged monopolist is immoral, or business built on and around aggression—the use of force and of noncontractual means of acquiring resources—is valid, in which case one must toss out the first theory. It is impossible to sustain both contentions and not to be inconsistent unless, of course, one could provide a principle that is more fundamental than both the nonaggression principle and the states’ right to aggressive violence and from which both, with the respective limitations regarding the domains in which they are valid, can be logically derived. However, liberalism never provided any such principle, nor will it ever be able to do so, since, to argue in favor of anything presupposes one’s right to be free of aggression. Given the fact then that the principle of nonaggression cannot be argumentatively contested as morally valid without implicitly acknowledging its validity, by force of logic one is committed to abandoning liberalism and accepting instead its more radical child: libertarianism, the philosophy of pure capitalism, which demands that the production of security be undertaken by private business too.

How would a system of nonmonopolistic, competing producers of security work? It should be clear from the outset that in answering this question one is leaving the realm of purely logical analysis and hence the answers must lack the certainty, the apodictic character of pronouncements on the validity of the public goods theory. The problem faced is precisely analogous to that of asking how a market would solve the problem of hamburger production, especially if up to this point hamburgers had been produced exclusively by the state and hence no one could draw on past experience. Only tentative answers could be formulated. No one could possibly know the exact structure of the hamburger industry—how many competing companies would come into existence, what importance this industry might have compared to others, what the hamburgers would look like, how many different sorts of hamburgers would appear on the market and perhaps disappear again because of a lack of demand, and so on. No one could know all of the circumstances and the changes that would influence the very structure of the hamburger industry—changes in the demands of various consumer groups, changes in technology, changes in the prices of various goods that affect the industry directly or indirectly, and so on. It must be stressed that although similar issues arise concerning the private production of security, this by no means implies that nothing definitive can be said. Assuming certain general conditions of demand for security services (conditions that more or less realistically reflect the world as it presently is) what can and will be said is how different social orders of security production, characterized by different structural constraints under which they have to operate, will respond differently.[^23] Let me first analyze the specifics of monopolistic, state-run security production, for at least in this case one can draw on ample evidence regarding the validity of the conclusions reached and then compare this system with what could be expected if it were replaced by a nonmonopolistic one.

[^23]: On the problem of competitive security production, see Gustave de Molinari, *Production of Security*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Power and Market* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1977), chap. 1; idem, *For A New Liberty* (New York: Macmillan, 1978), chap. 12; W.C. Woolridge, *Uncle Sam the Monopoly Man* (New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1970), chaps. 5–6; Morris and Linda Tannehill, *The Market for Liberty* (New York: Laissez Faire Books, 1984), part 2.

Even if security is considered to be a public good, in the allocation of scarce resources it must compete with other goods. What is spent on security can no longer be spent on other goods that also might increase consumer satisfaction. Moreover, security is not a single, homogeneous good, but rather consists of numerous components and aspects. There is not only prevention of crime, detection of criminals, and enforcement of the law, but there is also security from robbers, rapists, polluters, natural disasters, and so on. Moreover, security is not produced in a “lump,” but can be supplied in marginal units. In addition, different people attach different importance to security as a whole, and also to different aspects of the whole thing, depending on their personal characteristics, their past experiences with various factors of insecurity, and the time and place in which they happen to live.[^24] Here I address the fundamental economic problem of allocating scarce resources to competing uses, how can the state—an organization not financed exclusively by voluntary contributions and the sales of its products but rather partially or even wholly by taxes—decide how much security to produce, how much of each of its countless aspects, to whom and where to provide how much of what? The answer is that it has no rational way to decide this question. From the point of view of the consumers, its response to their security demands must be considered arbitrary. Do we need one policeman and one judge, or 100,000 of each? Should they be paid $100 a month or $10,000? Should the policemen, however many we might have, spend more time patrolling the streets, chasing robbers, and recovering stolen loot, or spying on participants in victimless crimes such as prostitution, drug use, or smuggling? And should the judges spend more time and energy hearing divorce cases, traffic violations, cases of shoplifting, and murder, or antitrust cases? Clearly, all of these questions must be answered somehow because as long as there is scarcity and we do not live in the Garden of Eden, the time and money spent on one thing cannot be spent on another. The state must answer these questions, too, but whatever it does, it does it without being subject to the profit-and-loss criterion. Hence, its action is arbitrary and necessarily involves countless wasteful misallocations from the consumer’s viewpoint.[^25] Independent to a large degree of consumer wants, the state-employed security producers instead do what they like. They hang around instead of doing anything, and if they do work they prefer doing what is easiest or work where they can wield power rather than serving consumers. Police officers drive around a lot, hassle petty traffic violators, spend huge amounts of money investigating victimless crimes that many people (i.e., nonparticipants) do not like but that few would be willing to spend their money on to fight, as they are not immediately affected by them. Yet with respect to what consumers want most urgently—the prevention of hardcore crime (i.e., crimes with victims), the apprehension and effective punishment of hard-core criminals, the recovery of loot, and the securement of compensation of victims of crimes from the aggressors—the police are notoriously inefficient, in spite of ever higher budget allocations.

[^24]: See Manfred Murck, *Soziologie der Öffentlichen Sicherheit* (Frankfurt: Campus, 1980).

[^25]: To say that the process of resource allocation becomes arbitrary in the absence of the effective functioning of the profit-loss criterion does not mean that the decisions that somehow have to he made are not subject to any kind of constraint and hence are pure whim. They are not, and any such decisions face certain constraints imposed on the decision maker. If, for instance, the allocation of production factors is decided democratically, then it evidently must appeal to the majority. But if a decision is constrained in this way or if it is made in any other way, it is still arbitrary from the point of view of voluntarily buying or not-buying consumers.

    Regarding *democratically* controlled allocations, various deficiencies have become quite evident. As, for example, James Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner write (*The Consequences of Mr. Keynes* [London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1978], p. 19):

    > Market competition is continuous; at each purchase, a buyer is able to select among competing sellers. Political competition is intermittent; a decision is binding generally for a fixed number of years. Market competition allows several competitors to survive simultaneously…. Political competition leads to an all-or-nothing outcome…. In market competition the buyer can be reasonably certain as to just what it is that he will receive from his purchase. In political competition, the buyer is in effect purchasing the services of an agent, whom he cannot bind…. Moreover, because a politician needs to secure the cooperation of a majority of politicians, the meaning of a vote for a politician is less clean than that of a “vote” for a private firm.

    See also James M. Buchanan, “Individual Choice in Voting and the Market,” in idem, *Fiscal Theory and Political Economy* (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962); for a more general treatment of the problem Buchanan and Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent.*

    What has commonly been overlooked, though—especially by those who try to make a virtue of the fact that a democracy gives equal voting power to everyone, whereas consumer sovereignty allows for unequal “votes”—is the most important deficiency of all: Under a system of consumer sovereignty people might cast unequal votes but, in any case, they exercise control exclusively over things that they acquired through original appropriation or contract and hence are forced to act morally. Under a democracy of production everyone is assumed to have something to say regarding things one did not so acquire; hence, one is permanently invited thereby not only to create legal instability with all its negative effects on the process of capital formation, but, moreover to act immorally. See on this also Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981), chap. 31.

Furthermore, whatever state-employed police or judges happen to do (arbitrary as it must be), they will tend to do poorly because their income is more or less independent of the consumer’s evaluations of their services. Thus one observes police arbitrariness and brutality and the slowness in the judicial process. Moreover, it is remarkable that neither the police nor the judicial system offers consumers anything even faintly resembling a service contract in which it is laid down in unambiguous terms what procedure the consumer can expect to be set in motion in a specific situation. Rather, both operate in a contractual void that over time allows them to change their rules of procedure arbitrarily and that explains the truly ridiculous fact that the settlement of disputes between police and judges on the one hand and private citizens on the other is not assigned to an independent third party, but to another policeman or judge who shares employers with one party—the government—in the dispute.
