Pero ang teorya sa pangpublikong baligya kay maguba dili lang tungod sa way klaro nga pagrason pahintungod sa moralidad nga gipakita niini. Bisan ang utalitaryan, ang pang-ekonomiya nga pagrason sulod aning pakiglalis sa taas kay sayop gayud. Sama sa giingon sa pangpublikong baligya na teorya, nga mas maayo pa siguro nga adunang pangpublikong mga baligya kaysa sa wala ta ani, pero dili nato kalimtan ang hingpin nga raso nga kini kay dapat gikilangan gyud (nga muabot gyud aning mga pangpublikong baligya nga mga pagrason s mga teorista diri). Kay klaro gyud kaayo, ug tinood nga sakto gyud kini, nga ang mga anarkista kay ana nga pwerteng gyung naglagor sa mga buhat sa estado nga mas gusto pa nila nga wala nalang gyud ng gitawag nga pangpublikong mga baligya kaysa sa ang estado pa ang muhatag niini.[^16] Bisag unsa pa man, bisan pa ug ang argumento kay gidawat, ang pag-ambak sa giingon nga ang mga pangpublikong baligya kay gikinahanglan padung sa giingod nga dapat sila ihatag sa estado kay walay katapusang hatol, kay kini dili kini mao ang napili kung unsaon ni pag-atubang. Tungod kay ang kwarta o maski usa nga gigikanan kay dapat kuhaon gikan sa laing posibleng pamaagi para maka gasto aning mga maayong pangpublikong mga baligya, ang sakto nga pangutana kay kung ang kining mga alternatibo kung diin ang kwarta kay pede ibutang (mao na, nga ang mga pribadong baligya, nga mahimo untang kuhaon pero karon kay dili na mapalit kay ang kwarta kay gigasto na sa pang publikong mga baligya) kay mas mahal-mas gikinahanglan ba o dili kaysa sa pangpublikong mga baligya. Ug ang tuban aning pangutana kay klaro kaayo. Mahitungod sa pag-susi sa mga mupalitay, bisag unsa pa kataas ang iyang absolute na ang-ang, ang kantidad sa mga pangpublikong baligya kay mas ubos kaysasa kompentensya nga mga pribadong baligya tungod kay kung ang pagpili kay atong ibilin sa mga mupalitay (ug wala sila gipugos sa usa ka pamaagi lang), klaro kaayo nga mas gustohon nilang nga igasto ang ilang kwarta sa laing pamaagi (kung diin walay laing pwersa ang gikinahanglan). Nagpakita lang kini nga walay pagduda nga ang mga resources nga gigamit para sa pagkuha aning mga pangpublikong baligya kay nasayang lang tungod kay naghatag sila sa mupalitay ug mga baligya o serbisyo nga dili kaayo importante. Sa laktud nga pagkasulti, bisan pa ug atong ibutang nga ang pangpublikong baligya kay pede nato ilain sa mga pribadong baligya, ug bisan pa nga atong ingnon nga pangpublikong baligya kay magamit, ang pangpublikong mga baligya kay kinahanglad pa makigkompetensiya sa mga pribadong baligya. Ug naa lay isa ka pamaagi para atong makita kung kini kay gikinahanglan ba gayud o wala ug sa unsa man sukod, o mutatis mutandis, kung, ug sa unsang sukod, ang ilang produksyon kay mahitabo ug nasayang lang ang dili-produksyon o gipahinay nga produksyon sa mga mas gikinahanglan na mga pribadong baligya: ang adunay paghatag sa libre nga pakig-kompetensiya sa mga pribadong negosyante. Mao na, sukwahi sa konklusyon nga nakuha sa mga teorista sa pangpublikong mga baligya, ang pang-hunahuna kay makapugos sa usa nga dawaton ang resulta nga ang puro nga merkado nga sistema ra gayud ang makabantay sa rasyonalidad, gikan sa pagtan-aw sa mga mupalitay, ang desisyon nga muhimo ug usa ka pangpublikong baligya. Ug ubos sa kapitalistang pagsugo ra gyud nga atong masiguro nga ang desisyon sa kung pila kabuok pangpublikong baligya ang himoon (kung kini kinahanglan ba himo) kay sakto ra sad.[^17] Walay ubos nga rebolusyon sa tinud-anay nga panglantaw nga Orweliian ang gikinahanglan para makaabot sa laing resulta. Kung ang usa kay muuyon lang nga ang pag-ingon sa uban ug "dili" nga nagpasabot gyud ug "oo," ang "dili pagpalit sa usa" isip nagpasabot "nga mas gipili ni nila kaysa sa gibuhat sa wala pagpalit sa usa ka tawo," sa "kusog" nga nagpasabot ug "kagawasan," sa "wala pagkontrata" nga nagpasabot nga "naghimo ug kontrata" ug uba pa, nga atong mapatud-an ang punto sa mga teorista sa pangpublikong mga baligya"[^18] Pero unsaon man nato pagsiguro nga tinud-anay ba gyud ilang giingon kung aduna silay gisulto, ug dili na noon ang sukwahi kaayo niini, o wala gyud kini maski unsa nga klaro kaayo nga sulod, pero puro lang pagyawyaw? Dili nato mahibaw-an. Mao nang sakto kaayo si Murray N. Rothbard sa iyang komento nga ang mga butang mahitungod sa mga paglantaw sa pangpublikong mga baligya ang magpamatuod sa giingon nga kapakyasan sa merkado tungod sa wala paghimo o gidaghanon o dekalidad "kulang" nga paghimo msa usa ka pangpublikong mga baligya. Iyang gisulat,

[^16]: Tan-awa kining argumento ni Rothbard sa, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” p. 533. Mao nang ang usa ka buok anarkista kay makapamatuod nga walay klaro ang tanang reperensya sa pagpanindot sa Pareto isip usa ka sukdanan sa saktong aksyon sa estado para sa ekonomiya.

[^17]: Mao ni ang parehong pagrason ang magtuklod sa usa nga dili dawaton ang sosyalista-statista na teorya nga nahimo base sa gituohang abilidad sa pangpublikong mga baligya nga gitagaan ug bili tungod sa usa ka sukdan sa nonexclludability, mao pud ang mu-applu dire, ug dili, ang kaning mga baligya kay gitagaan ug sakto nga gibug-aton pinaagi sa walay komptensya nga pagpalit (tan-aww ang note 6 ug 12 sa taas). Usa pa, para makaabot sa giingon nga sila kay dapat sila ihatag gikay sa giingon nga ang mga mga baligya nga niuyon sa walay kompetensya nga pagpalit kay dili ihatag sa libreng merkado sa daghang mga mupalitay, kining maong teorya kay muatobang ra pud sa parehong problema sa pagkinahanglang sa pamataasan nga atong maingon nga sakto. Lain pa, ang mga utalitaryan nga pagsabot kay klaro kaayo nga sayop sad. Ang pagrason, sama sa teorista sa pangpublikong mga baligya, nga ang libreng-merkado nga pagbuhat sa wala pagpaapil sa libreng manakayay sa pag-angkon ug mga baligya ang mahimong rason sa walay kompentensiya nga pagpalit nga walay gasto ang magpakita sa dili kaayo maayo nga ang-ang sa panglantaw sa atong dakbayan ug tungod ang kinahanglan nga aksyon sa estado kay sayop sa duha ka pagtan-aw. Una, ang gasto kay usa ka subjective nga kategorya ug dili gyud objectively masukod maski bisag kinsa nga nagtan-aw sa gawas. Mao nang, ang pag-ingon nga ang pagdungag ug libreng manakayay nga walay gasyo kay dili gyud madawat. Tinud-anay lang, kung ang subjective nga gasto sa pagdawat ug daghang mupalitay nga walay gasyo kay wala gyud, ang pribardong tag-iya ug naghimo sa mga baligya nga atong gistoryahan ang makabuhat ani. Kung dili ni niya buhaton, nagpakita kini nga aduna gyuy gasto para sa iya ang pagbuhat niini. Ang rason siguro kay ang iyang pagtuo nga ang pagbuhat niini kay magpaubos sa pag-uyon sa ubang mga mupalitay ug murag muubos na noon ang presyo sa iyang produkto; o siguro di lang gyud siya ganahan sa mga wala giimbita nga libreng manakayay, butang talang, kung dili ko uyon sa plano nga akong ihatag akong dili kayo puno nga sala sa nagkalain-lain mga tawo nga nag-imbita ug mga kostumer para sa walay kompetensiya nga pagpalit. Bisag unsang kaso, ug kung unsa mang rason, ang gasto kay dili gyud nato maingon nga wala, mao nang sayop gyud ang pag-ingon ug kapalpakan sa merkado kung naay mga baligya nga wala gihatag nga libre. Sa laing bahin, ang pagkalugi kay tinud-anay nga dili malikayan kung ang usa kay mudawat sa rekomendasyon sa mga teorista sa pangpublikong mga baligya nga pasagdaan ang mga baligya nga mutugot sa walay kompetensya nga pagpalit nga gihatag sa estado nga walay gasyo. Bisan pa ang lisod kaayo nga tahas sa pag-atiman kung unsa ang makapatuman nga raso, ang estado, nga wala nagbase sa pagpalit sa mga mupalitay, kay unang muatubang sa dili masulbad nga problema ang pagtanto kung pila ang ihatag nga pangpublikong baligya. Klaro kayo, tungod kay maski ang mga pangpublikong baligya kay dili libre pero nahiubos sa "crowding", walay punto sa pag-undang ang estado, tungod kay maski unsa nga ang-ang sa suplay, naa gyuy mga gumamitay ang dili nato maapil ug naay, mga dagkong suplay, ang malipay sa ilang libreng pagsakay. Pero bisan pa ug kining problema kay milagrong masulbad, bisag unsa nga kaso (kinahanglan nga pagsaka) ang gasto sa produskyon ug operasyon sa mga pangpublikong baligya kay gihatag nga walay gasto gikan sa walay kompentensya nga pagpalit kay dapat bayaran sa mga buhis. Ug kini, mao, ang kamatuoran nga ang mga mupalitay kay mapugos sa pag-gamit sa ilang libreng mga sakay, ug kini nagpamatuod na pud nga walay pagduha-duha nga king mga pangpublikong mga baligya pud, kay naay ubos nga kantidad gikan sa panlantaw sa mga mupalitay kay sa sa mga nikomptesya nga mga pribadong baligya nga dili na nila pwede makuha.

[^18]: The most prominent modern champions of Orwellian double talk are Buchanan and Tullock (see their works cited in note 3 above). They claim that government is founded by a “constitutional contract” in which everyone “conceptually agrees” to submit to the coercive powers of government with the understanding that everyone else is subject to it too. Hence government is only *seemingly* coercive but *really* voluntary. There are several evident objections to this curious argument. First, there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for the contention that any constitution has ever been voluntarily accepted by everyone concerned. Worse, the very idea of all people voluntarily coercing themselves is simply inconceivable, much in the same way as it is inconceivable to deny the law of contradiction. For if the voluntarily accepted coercion is voluntary, then it would have to be possible to revoke one’s subjection to the constitution, and the state would be no more than a voluntarily joined club. If, however, one does not have the “right to ignore the state”—and that one does not have this right is, of course, the characteristic mark of a state as compared to a club—then it would be logically inadmissible to claim that one’s acceptance of state coercion is voluntary. Furthermore, even if all this were possible, the constitutional contact could still not claim to bind anyone except the original signers of the constitution.

    How can Buchanan and Tullock come up with such absurd ideas? By a semantic trick. What was “inconceivable” and “no agreement” in pre-Orwellian talk is for them “conceptually possible” and a “conceptual agreement.” For a most instructive short exercise in this sort of reasoning in leaps and bounds, see James Buchanan, “A Contractarian Perspective on Anarchy,” in idem, *Freedom in Constitutional Contract* (College Station: Texas A&M University Press, 1977). Here we learn (p. l7) that even the acceptance of the 55 mph speed limit is possibly voluntary (Buchanan is not quite sure) since it ultimately rests on all of us conceptually agreeing on the constitution, and that Buchanan is not really a statist, but in truth an anarchist (p. 11).

> [s]uch a view completely economic science asserts that free-market action is *ever* optimal. It is optimal, not from the standpoint of the personal ethical views of an economist, but from the standpoint of free, voluntary actions of all participants and in satisfying the freely expressed needs of the consumers. Government interference, therefore, will necessarily and always move *away* from such an optimum.[^19]

[^19]: Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 887.

Indeed, the arguments supposedly proving market failures are nothing short of patently absurd. Stripped of their disguise of technical jargon all they prove is this: A market is not perfect, as it is characterized by the nonaggression principle imposed on conditions marked by scarcity, and so certain goods or services that could only be produced and provided if aggression were allowed will not be produced. True enough, but no market theorist would ever dare deny this. Yet, and this is decisive, this “imperfection” of the market can be defended, morally as well as economically, whereas the supposed “perfections” of markets propagated by the public goods theorists cannot.[^20] It is also true that a termination of the state’s current practice of providing public goods would imply some change in the existing social structure and the distribution of wealth. Such a reshuffling would certainly imply hardship for some people. As a matter of fact, this is precisely why there is widespread public resistance to a policy of privatizing state functions, even though in the long run overall social wealth would be enhanced by this very policy. Surely, however, this fact cannot be accepted as a valid argument demonstrating the failure of markets. If a man has been allowed to hit other people on the head and is now not permitted to continue with this practice, he is certainly hurt. But one would hardly accept that as a valid excuse for upholding the old (hitting) rules. He is harmed, but harming him means substituting a social order in which every consumer has an equal right to determine what and how much of anything is produced, for a system in which some consumers have the right to determine in what respect other consumers are not allowed to buy voluntarily what they want with the means justly acquired by them and at their disposal. Certainly, such a substitution would be preferable from the point of view of all consumers as voluntary consumers.

[^20]: This, first of all, should be kept in mind whenever one has to assess the validity of statist-interventionist arguments such as the following, by John Maynard Keynes (“The End of Laissez Faire,” in idem, *Collected Writings*, London: Macmillan, 1972, vol. IX, p. 291):

    > The most important Agenda of the state relates not to those activities which private individuals are already fulfilling but to those functions which fall outside the sphere of the individual, to those decisions which are made by no one if the state does not make them. The important thing for government is not to do things which individuals are doing already and to do them a little better or a little worse: but to do those things which are not done at all.

    This reasoning not only *appears* phony, it truly is.

By force of logical reasoning, one must accept Molinari’s conclusion that for the sake of consumers, all goods and services be provided by markets.[^21] It is not only false that clearly distinguishable categories of goods exist, which would render special amendments to the general thesis of capitalism’s economic superiority necessary; even if they did exist, no special reason could be found why these supposedly special public goods should not also be produced by private enterprises, since they invariably stand in competition with private goods. In fact, in spite of all the propaganda from the public goods theorists, the greater efficiency of markets as compared with the state is increasingly realized with respect to more and more of the alleged public goods. Confronted daily with experience, hardly anyone seriously studying these matters could deny that nowadays markets could produce postal services, railroads, electricity, telephone, education, money, roads and so on more effectively than the state, i.e., more to the liking of consumers. Yet people generally shy away from accepting in one particular sector what logic forces upon them: in the production of security. Hence, for the rest of this chapter I will turn my attention to explaining the superior functioning of a capitalist economy in this particular area—a superiority whose logical case has already been made by now, but which shall be rendered more persuasive once some empirical material is added to the analysis and it is studied as a problem in its own right.[^22]

[^21]: Some libertarian minarchists object that the existence of a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of a common body of law, and hence a government as a monopolistic judge and enforcement agency. (See, for example, John Hospers, *Libertarianism* [Los Angeles: Nash, 1971]; Tibor Machan, *Human Rights and Human Liberties* [Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1975].) Now it is certainly correct that a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of those rules that underlie its operation. But from this it does not follow that this task must be entrusted to a monopolistic agency. In fact, a common language or sign-system is also presupposed by the market; but one would hardly think it convincing to conclude that hence the government must ensure the observance of the rules of language. Like the system of language, then, the rules of market behavior emerge spontaneously and can be enforced by the “invisible hand” of self-interest. Without the observance of common rules of speech, people could not reap the advantages that communication offers, and without the observance of common rules of conduct, people could not enjoy the benefits of the higher productivity of an exchange economy based on the division of labor. In addition, as I indicated above, independent of any government the nonaggression principle underlying the operation of markets can be defended a priori as just. Moreover, as I will argue in the conclusion of this chapter, it is precisely a competitive system of law-administration and law-enforcement that generates the greatest possible pressure to elaborate and enact rules of conduct that incorporate the highest degree of *consensus* conceivable. And of course the very rules that do just this are those that a priori reasoning establishes as the logically necessary presupposition of argumentation and argumentative agreement.

[^22]: Incidentally, the same logic that would force one to accept the idea of the production of security by private business as economically the best solution to the problem of consumer satisfaction also forces one, so far as moral-ideological positions are concerned, to abandon the political theory of classical liberalism and take the small but nevertheless decisive step (from there) to the theory of libertarianism, or private property anarchism. Classical liberalism, with Ludwig von Mises as its foremost representative in the twentieth century, advocates a social system based on the nonaggression principle. And this is also what libertarianism advocates. But classical liberalism then wants to have this principle enforced by a monopolistic agency (the government, the state)—an organization, that is, which is not exclusively dependent on voluntary, contractual support by the consumers of its respective services, but instead has the right to unilaterally determine its own income, i.e., the taxes to be imposed on consumers in order to do its job in the area of security production. Now, however plausible this might sound, it should be clear that it is inconsistent. Either the principle of nonaggression is valid, in which case the state as a privileged monopolist is immoral, or business built on and around aggression—the use of force and of noncontractual means of acquiring resources—is valid, in which case one must toss out the first theory. It is impossible to sustain both contentions and not to be inconsistent unless, of course, one could provide a principle that is more fundamental than both the nonaggression principle and the states’ right to aggressive violence and from which both, with the respective limitations regarding the domains in which they are valid, can be logically derived. However, liberalism never provided any such principle, nor will it ever be able to do so, since, to argue in favor of anything presupposes one’s right to be free of aggression. Given the fact then that the principle of nonaggression cannot be argumentatively contested as morally valid without implicitly acknowledging its validity, by force of logic one is committed to abandoning liberalism and accepting instead its more radical child: libertarianism, the philosophy of pure capitalism, which demands that the production of security be undertaken by private business too.

How would a system of nonmonopolistic, competing producers of security work? It should be clear from the outset that in answering this question one is leaving the realm of purely logical analysis and hence the answers must lack the certainty, the apodictic character of pronouncements on the validity of the public goods theory. The problem faced is precisely analogous to that of asking how a market would solve the problem of hamburger production, especially if up to this point hamburgers had been produced exclusively by the state and hence no one could draw on past experience. Only tentative answers could be formulated. No one could possibly know the exact structure of the hamburger industry—how many competing companies would come into existence, what importance this industry might have compared to others, what the hamburgers would look like, how many different sorts of hamburgers would appear on the market and perhaps disappear again because of a lack of demand, and so on. No one could know all of the circumstances and the changes that would influence the very structure of the hamburger industry—changes in the demands of various consumer groups, changes in technology, changes in the prices of various goods that affect the industry directly or indirectly, and so on. It must be stressed that although similar issues arise concerning the private production of security, this by no means implies that nothing definitive can be said. Assuming certain general conditions of demand for security services (conditions that more or less realistically reflect the world as it presently is) what can and will be said is how different social orders of security production, characterized by different structural constraints under which they have to operate, will respond differently.[^23] Let me first analyze the specifics of monopolistic, state-run security production, for at least in this case one can draw on ample evidence regarding the validity of the conclusions reached and then compare this system with what could be expected if it were replaced by a nonmonopolistic one.

[^23]: On the problem of competitive security production, see Gustave de Molinari, *Production of Security*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Power and Market* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1977), chap. 1; idem, *For A New Liberty* (New York: Macmillan, 1978), chap. 12; W.C. Woolridge, *Uncle Sam the Monopoly Man* (New Rochelle, N.Y.: Arlington House, 1970), chaps. 5–6; Morris and Linda Tannehill, *The Market for Liberty* (New York: Laissez Faire Books, 1984), part 2.

Even if security is considered to be a public good, in the allocation of scarce resources it must compete with other goods. What is spent on security can no longer be spent on other goods that also might increase consumer satisfaction. Moreover, security is not a single, homogeneous good, but rather consists of numerous components and aspects. There is not only prevention of crime, detection of criminals, and enforcement of the law, but there is also security from robbers, rapists, polluters, natural disasters, and so on. Moreover, security is not produced in a “lump,” but can be supplied in marginal units. In addition, different people attach different importance to security as a whole, and also to different aspects of the whole thing, depending on their personal characteristics, their past experiences with various factors of insecurity, and the time and place in which they happen to live.[^24] Here I address the fundamental economic problem of allocating scarce resources to competing uses, how can the state—an organization not financed exclusively by voluntary contributions and the sales of its products but rather partially or even wholly by taxes—decide how much security to produce, how much of each of its countless aspects, to whom and where to provide how much of what? The answer is that it has no rational way to decide this question. From the point of view of the consumers, its response to their security demands must be considered arbitrary. Do we need one policeman and one judge, or 100,000 of each? Should they be paid $100 a month or $10,000? Should the policemen, however many we might have, spend more time patrolling the streets, chasing robbers, and recovering stolen loot, or spying on participants in victimless crimes such as prostitution, drug use, or smuggling? And should the judges spend more time and energy hearing divorce cases, traffic violations, cases of shoplifting, and murder, or antitrust cases? Clearly, all of these questions must be answered somehow because as long as there is scarcity and we do not live in the Garden of Eden, the time and money spent on one thing cannot be spent on another. The state must answer these questions, too, but whatever it does, it does it without being subject to the profit-and-loss criterion. Hence, its action is arbitrary and necessarily involves countless wasteful misallocations from the consumer’s viewpoint.[^25] Independent to a large degree of consumer wants, the state-employed security producers instead do what they like. They hang around instead of doing anything, and if they do work they prefer doing what is easiest or work where they can wield power rather than serving consumers. Police officers drive around a lot, hassle petty traffic violators, spend huge amounts of money investigating victimless crimes that many people (i.e., nonparticipants) do not like but that few would be willing to spend their money on to fight, as they are not immediately affected by them. Yet with respect to what consumers want most urgently—the prevention of hardcore crime (i.e., crimes with victims), the apprehension and effective punishment of hard-core criminals, the recovery of loot, and the securement of compensation of victims of crimes from the aggressors—the police are notoriously inefficient, in spite of ever higher budget allocations.

[^24]: See Manfred Murck, *Soziologie der Öffentlichen Sicherheit* (Frankfurt: Campus, 1980).

[^25]: To say that the process of resource allocation becomes arbitrary in the absence of the effective functioning of the profit-loss criterion does not mean that the decisions that somehow have to he made are not subject to any kind of constraint and hence are pure whim. They are not, and any such decisions face certain constraints imposed on the decision maker. If, for instance, the allocation of production factors is decided democratically, then it evidently must appeal to the majority. But if a decision is constrained in this way or if it is made in any other way, it is still arbitrary from the point of view of voluntarily buying or not-buying consumers.

    Regarding *democratically* controlled allocations, various deficiencies have become quite evident. As, for example, James Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner write (*The Consequences of Mr. Keynes* [London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1978], p. 19):

    > Market competition is continuous; at each purchase, a buyer is able to select among competing sellers. Political competition is intermittent; a decision is binding generally for a fixed number of years. Market competition allows several competitors to survive simultaneously…. Political competition leads to an all-or-nothing outcome…. In market competition the buyer can be reasonably certain as to just what it is that he will receive from his purchase. In political competition, the buyer is in effect purchasing the services of an agent, whom he cannot bind…. Moreover, because a politician needs to secure the cooperation of a majority of politicians, the meaning of a vote for a politician is less clean than that of a “vote” for a private firm.

    See also James M. Buchanan, “Individual Choice in Voting and the Market,” in idem, *Fiscal Theory and Political Economy* (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962); for a more general treatment of the problem Buchanan and Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent.*

    What has commonly been overlooked, though—especially by those who try to make a virtue of the fact that a democracy gives equal voting power to everyone, whereas consumer sovereignty allows for unequal “votes”—is the most important deficiency of all: Under a system of consumer sovereignty people might cast unequal votes but, in any case, they exercise control exclusively over things that they acquired through original appropriation or contract and hence are forced to act morally. Under a democracy of production everyone is assumed to have something to say regarding things one did not so acquire; hence, one is permanently invited thereby not only to create legal instability with all its negative effects on the process of capital formation, but, moreover to act immorally. See on this also Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981), chap. 31.

Furthermore, whatever state-employed police or judges happen to do (arbitrary as it must be), they will tend to do poorly because their income is more or less independent of the consumer’s evaluations of their services. Thus one observes police arbitrariness and brutality and the slowness in the judicial process. Moreover, it is remarkable that neither the police nor the judicial system offers consumers anything even faintly resembling a service contract in which it is laid down in unambiguous terms what procedure the consumer can expect to be set in motion in a specific situation. Rather, both operate in a contractual void that over time allows them to change their rules of procedure arbitrarily and that explains the truly ridiculous fact that the settlement of disputes between police and judges on the one hand and private citizens on the other is not assigned to an independent third party, but to another policeman or judge who shares employers with one party—the government—in the dispute.
