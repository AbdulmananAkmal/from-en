## O Quarto Teste: Fraude

Exactamente no limite do que, geralmente, é considerado ético, assenta-se o desafio de *fraude*.

A fraude é a obtenção de valor através de uma representação falsa. Se eu disser que lhe vou enviar um iPod, se me der duzentos dólares e depois tomo o seu dinheiro sem lhe enviar o iPod, percebemos instintivamente que essa é uma forma de roubo.

Vamos colocar o problema da fraude através do moinho do CUP e ver se ele resiste.

Evidentemente, a fraude exige que uma pessoa *não* esteja envolvida na fraude. Na transacção potencial anterior, se eu estiver à espera de roubar os seus duzentos dólares, e você à espera de roubar o meu iPod, não haverá nada disso. Você irá exigir o iPod antes de o pagar, e eu exigirei o pagamento antes de lhe entregar o iPod. Ficaremos num impasse, totalmente incapazes de defraudar um ao outro.

Obviamente, para que ocorra uma fraude, uma das partes deve agir de boa fé. Assim, a pessoa que deseja cometer uma fraude baseia-se no facto de que a outra pessoa *não* deseja cometer fraude, para a poder enganar.

To return to our hapless moral guinea pigs, what would happen if we asked Bob and Doug to act on the moral principle that “fraud is good”? If Doug has twenty dollars, and Bob has a lighter, and Doug offers Bob twenty dollars for that lighter, and then takes the lighter but does not give Bob the twenty dollars, then Doug has been acting on the premise that fraud is good.

What happens then?

Clearly, the principle that “fraud is good” cannot be acted on by both Doug and Bob simultaneously – since in order to commit fraud, Doug must act dishonestly, and Bob must act honestly. Thus to enable Doug’s “moral” action, Bob must act “immorally.”

UPB destroys this possibility, since no valid moral theory can require opposite actions under the same circumstances.

If Doug commits fraud on Bob with the justification that “it is good to lie to get what you want,” then clearly it must also be good to be honest as well, since it is impossible to get what you want by lying unless other people are willing to assume your honesty. Thus the premise that it is good to lie to get what you want cannot be achieved unless other people act with integrity – thus lying and honesty are simultaneously required for the fulfilment of the moral principle. This cannot logically stand – that both an action *and its complete opposite* are simultaneously moral in the same place, for the same people, and at the same time.

This is how we know that fraud is wrong.

Again, knowing that fraud is “wrong” simply means that we know that any moral theory that justifies fraud is invalid, because it is self-contradictory. If we build a bridge, and the bridge falls down, we know that the bridge was “wrong” – but the most important thing that we can learn from this disaster is not that the bridge fell down, but to understand the flaws in the theory that caused us to build a bridge that fell down. Similarly, moral theories that cause disasters, such as communism, fascism and Nazism, are important to evaluate relative to UPB not only so we can understand how they went so wrong, but also how to fix our moral theories in the future. Since as a species, we will be forever building bridges, it is essential that we get our facts and theories right, or they will endlessly fall down around us.

However, the question remains whether fraud is evil, or just an aesthetically negative action (ANA).

Fraud is unusual compared to rape, theft and murder, insofar as it requires that the victim act positively to participate in the process. I can jump up behind you and strangle you without any participation on your part, but I cannot defraud you unless you participate to some degree. Thus fraud falls under the umbrella of “avoidability,” and so is in a fundamentally different category than rape, murder and theft. However, the degree of avoidability partly determines the degree of immorality involved. Sending your bank information to a Nigerian email spammer is certainly avoidable; being cheated by an eBay business with a perfect rating is far less avoidable.

There may be certain situations under which fraud is unavoidable, such as “bartering” for a life-saving medicine when no alternative exists, but that falls under the “grey area” that we have discussed above – these occurrences are so rare that they are to ethics as mutations are to biological species.
