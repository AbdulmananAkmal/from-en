## Iniciação

Uma teoria moral razoável deve ser capaz de explicar todos os padrões universais anteriores, tal como uma teoria razoável da física deve ser capaz de explicar como um homem, inconscientemente, pode calcular o arco de uma bola de basebol lançada pelo ar e apanhá-la.

Se a estrutura do CUP consegue explicar o anterior, então certamente passou, pelo menos, o teste de "sentido comum".

Isso não significa que algumas conclusões surpreendentes - mesmo chocantes - não possam resultar da nossa teoria moral, mas pelo menos teremos passado o primeiro obstáculo de explicar o óbvio, antes de analisar o que está longe de ser óbvio.

Com isso em mente, passemos à questão de *iniciação*.

Um cirurgião pode "cortá-lo" com um bisturi, mas podemos entender facilmente que a sua acção é muito diferente da de um assaltante que o faça com uma faca.

Esta diferença pode ser entendida através de uma análise adicional de *iniciação*.

Se tiver cancro, pode pedir a um cirurgião para operá-lo. A razão pela qual o "corte" do cirurgião não é imoral é que o cancro "iniciou" um ataque à sua vida e saúde. O cirurgião age como um "agente substituto de defesa autónomo", como um homem que atira a um assaltante que o está a atacar. Você também deu o seu consentimento ao cirurgião e vinculou o seu comportamento por um contrato específico.

The mugger who stabs you, however, is initiating an attack upon your life and health, which is why his attack is the moral *opposite* of the surgeon’s efforts.

If I am a chronic and long-time smoker, I have participated in the chain of events that lead to my lung cancer. By initiating and maintaining the habit of smoking, I have set into motion a chain of causality that can result in a life-threatening affliction. It is certainly possible for me to get lung cancer without smoking – or smoke without getting lung cancer – but I certainly have affected the odds.

Similarly, it is possible for me to leave my wallet on a park bench for a week, return and find it still sitting there, but by leaving it there for such a long time, I certainly have affected the odds of it being gone.

On the other hand, if I stay home every night, I am not exactly courting crime, and so if a maniac invades my home and robs me blind, I cannot be reasonably blamed for any causal role I have played in the incident.

### The Non-Aggression Principle (NAP)

A moral rule is often proposed called the *non-aggression principle*, or NAP. It is also called being a “porcupine pacifist,” insofar as a porcupine only uses “force” in self-defence The NAP is basically the proposition that “the initiation of the use of force is morally wrong.” Or, to put it more in the terms of our conversation: “The non-initiation of force is universally preferable”.

When we analyse a principle such as the NAP, there are really only seven possibilities: three in the negative, three in the positive, and one neutral:

- The initiation of the use of force is always morally wrong.
- The initiation of the use of force is sometimes morally wrong.
- The initiation of the use of force is never morally wrong.
- The initiation of the use of force has no moral content.
- The initiation of the use of force is never morally right.
- The initiation of the use of force is sometimes morally right.
- The initiation of the use of force is always morally right.

As we have seen above, however, UPB is an “all or nothing” framework. If an action is *universally preferable*, then it cannot be limited by individual, geography, time etc. If it is wrong to murder in Algiers, then it is also wrong to murder in Belgium, the United States, at the North Pole and on the moon. If it is wrong to murder yesterday, then it cannot be right to murder tomorrow. If it is wrong for Bob to murder, then it must also be wrong for Doug to murder.

Uniting the NAP with UPB, thus allows us to whittle these seven statements down to three:

1. It is universally preferable to initiate the use of force.
2. It is universally preferable to not initiate the use of force.
3. The initiation of the use of force is not subject to universal preferences.

This is the natural result of applying the requirement of rational consistency to ethical propositions. A rational theory cannot validly propose that opposite results can occur from the same circumstances. A scientific theory cannot argue that one rock must fall down, but another rock must fall up. Einstein did not argue that E=MC^2^ on a Thursday, but that E=MC^3^ on a Friday, or on Mars, or during a blue moon. The law of conservation – that matter can be neither created nor destroyed – does not hold true only when you really, really want it to, or if you pay a guy to make it so, or when a black cat crosses your path. The laws of physics are not subject to time, geography, opinion or acts of Congress. This consistency must also be required for systems of ethics, or UPB, and we will subject generally accepted moral theories to this rigour in Part Two, in a few pages.

However, since we are dealing with the question of *consistency*, it is well worth taking the time to deal with our capacity for *inconsistency*.
