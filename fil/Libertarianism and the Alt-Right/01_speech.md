Alam natin ang kapalaran ng terminong liberal at liberalismo. Ito ay nakakabit sa napakaraming iba't ibang tao at iba't ibang mga posisyon na nawala ang lahat ng kahulugan nito at naging isang walang laman, di-descript label. Ang parehong kapalaran ngayon ay lalong nagbabanta din sa salitang libertarian at libertarianism na inimbento upang mabawi ang ilan sa mga haka-haka katumpakan na nawala sa pagkamatay ng mga dating label.

Gayunpaman, ang kasaysayan ng modernong libertarianism ay medyo bata pa. Nagsimula ito sa sala ni Murray Rothbard at natagpuan ang kanyang unang quasi-canonical expression sa kanyang *Para sa isang bagong kalayaan. Isang Libertaryan Manifesto*, na inilathala noong 1973. At sa gayon ay umaasa pa rin ako at hindi pa handang sumuko sa libertarianism tulad ng nilinaw at ipinaliwanag ni Rothbard sa walang kapantay na haka-haka at katumpakan ng haka-haka, sa kabila ng hindi mabilang na mga pagtatangka ng mga tinatawag na libertarians na magpaligo sa tubig at hindi wasto ang mabuting pangalan ng libertarianism para sa isang bagay na lubos na naiiba.

Ang teoretikal, hindi maisasagot na core ng libertaryan doktrina ay simple at tapat at ipinaliwanag ko na ito ng paulit-ulit sa lugar na ito. Kung walang kakulangan sa mundo, imposible ang mga salungatan ng tao o mas tiyak na pisikal na clashes ay imposible. Ang mga salungatan sa pagitan ng mga tao ay laging salungat sa mga bagay na mahirap makuha. Gusto kong gawin ang A sa isang bagay at gusto mong gawin ang B sa parehong bagay. Dahil sa mga salungat na ito - at dahil nakikipag-usap kami at nagtatalo sa isa't isa - hinahanap namin ang mga kaugalian ng pag-uugali na may layunin ng pag-iwas sa mga salungat na ito. Ang layunin ng mga kaugalian ay pag-iwas sa pagkakasalungatan. Kung hindi namin nais na maiwasan ang mga labanan, ang paghahanap para sa mga kaugalian ng pag-uugali ay magiging walang kahulugan. Gusto lang nating labanan at pakikibaka.

Kung wala ang perpektong pagkakaisa ng lahat ng interes, mga kontrahan tungkol sa mga mapagkukunan na kakulangan ay maiiwasan lamang kung ang lahat ng mga mapagkukunan na kakulangan ay itinalaga bilang pribado, eksklusibong ari-arian sa ilang tinukoy na indibidwal o grupo ng mga indibidwal. Lamang pagkatapos ay maaari akong kumilos nang nakapag-iisa, na may *aking* sariling mga bagay, mula sa iyo, na may *iyong* sariling mga bagay, walang ikaw at ako na magkalaban.

Ngunit sino ang nagmamay-ari ng kung ano ang kakulangan ng mapagkukunan bilang kanyang pribadong pag-aari at sino ang hindi? Una: Ang bawat tao ay nagmamay-ari ng kanyang pisikal na katawan na siya lamang at walang ibang kumokontrol *nang direkta*. At ikalawa, para sa kakulangan ng mga mapagkukunan na maaaring kontrolin *lamang* hindi direkta [^1]: Ang eksklusibong pagkontrol [^2] ay nakuha at itinalaga sa taong iyon, na inilaan ang mapagkukunan na pinag-uusapan *unang* o kung sino ang nakuha nito sa pamamagitan ng boluntaryong [^3] palitan mula sa *naunang* may-ari nito. Para lamang sa *unang*tagatangkilik ng isang mapagkukunan [^4] ay maaaring makuha at makakuha ng kontrol sa mga ito nang walang salungatan, ibig sabihin., patiwasay. Kung hindi man, kung ang eksklusibong kontrol ay itinalaga sa halip na *latecomers*, hindi maiiwasan ang labanan ngunit salungat sa mismong layunin ng mga kaugalian na hindi maiiwasan at permanente.

Bago ang manonood na ito ay hindi ko kailangan ng mas maraming detalye maliban na idagdag ito: Kung gusto mong mamuhay nang payapa sa ibang tao at iwasan ang lahat ng mga pisikal na labanan at, kung ang mga naturang labanan ay magaganap, hangarin mong malutas ang mga ito nang mapayapa, pagkatapos ay kailangan mong maging isang anarkista o mas tiyak na isang anarkista sa pribadong ari-arian, isang anarcho-kapitalista o isang tagapagtaguyod ng isang pribadong batas ng lipunan.

At sa pamamagitan ng implikasyon, pagkatapos, at muli nang walang higit pang ado: May isang tao, sinuman, ay *hindi* isang libertarian o isang lamang *peke* libertarian na nagpapatibay at nagtataguyod ng isa o higit pa sa mga sumusunod: ang pangangailangan ng isang Estado, anumang Estado, ng 'pampublikong' (Estado) na ari-arian at ng mga buwis upang mamuhay nang may kapayapaan; o ang pagkakaroon at katarungan ng anumang tinatawag na "karapatang pantao" o "mga karapatang sibil" maliban sa mga pribadong karapatan sa pag-aari, tulad ng "mga karapatan ng kababaihan," "karapatan ng gay," "mga karapatang pantao", ang "karapatan", hindi dapat ma-discriminated laban sa, ang " "karapatan" para sa libre at hindi ipinagpapahintulot na imigrasyon, ang "karapatan" sa isang garantisadong pinakamababang kita o sa libreng pangangalaga sa kalusugan, o ang "karapatan" upang maging malaya sa hindi kanais-nais na pagsasalita at pag-iisip. Ang mga tagapagtaguyod ng alinman sa mga ito ay maaaring tumawag sa kanilang sarili kung ano man ang gusto nila, at bilang mga libertarians maaari tayong makipagtulungan sa kanila, sa dahilang ang naturang pakikipagtulungan ay nag-aalok ng pangako na magdadala sa atin nang mas malapit sa ating pangunahing layunin, ngunit hindi sila *libertarians* o lamang *pekeng* libertarians.

Ngayon, "isang nakakatawang bagay ang nangyari sa daan patungo sa forum". Habang si Rothbard at ako, sumusunod sa kanyang mga yapak, ay hindi naliligaw mula sa mga teoriyang ito na nagmula sa paniniwala, hindi lamang mga di-libertarians ngunit sa partikular din na pekeng libertarians, ibig sabihin, ang mga tao na nag-aangking (maling) upang *maging* libertarians, at kahit na maraming posibleng tapat na di-witted na libertarians ang napili at ipinagbabawal sa amin bilang kanilang paboritong *betes noires* at incarnates ng kasamaan. Rothbard, ang *spiritus rector* ng modernong libertarianism, ay binansagan ng tinatawag na "anti-pasistang" karamihan ng tao bilang isang reaksyonaryo, isang rasista, isang sekswal, isang awtoritaryan, isang elitista, isang xenophobe, isang pasista at, sa itaas ang lahat ng ito, isang self-hating Jewish Nazi. At minana ko ang lahat ng mga honorary na pamagat, kasama ang ilan pa (maliban sa mga bagay na Jewish). Kaya anong nakakatawang bagay ang nangyari dito?

Ang pagsisikap na bumuo ng isang sagot sa tanong na ito ay nagdudulot sa akin sa paksa ng pagsasalita na ito: ang relasyon sa pagitan ng libertarianismo at ang alternatibong karapatan o "Alt-Right," na nakakuha ng pambansa at internasyunal na pagkalalaki pagkatapos ni Hillary Clinton, sa huling kampanya sa halalan sa pampanguluhan, kinilala ito bilang isa sa mga mapagkukunang inspirational sa likod ng "basket ng deplorables" rooting para sa trump [^5].

Ang kilusang Alt-Right ay mahalagang tagumpay ng kilusang paleo-konserbatibo na nakilala sa unang bahagi ng dekada ng 1990, na may kolumnista at pinakamahusay na nagbebenta ng may-akda na si Patrick Buchanan bilang pinakakilalang kinatawan nito. Ito ay medyo natutulog sa huling bahagi ng dekada ng 1990, at kamakailan lamang, sa liwanag ng tuluy-tuloy na lumalagong pinsala na ginawa sa Amerika at ang reputasyon nito sa sunud-sunod na Bush I, Clinton, Bush II at mga administrasyon ni Obama, ay muling nakabubuti kaysa bago sa ilalim ng bagong etiketa ng Alt-Right. Marami sa mga nangungunang ilaw na nauugnay sa Alt-Right ay lumitaw dito sa aming mga pagpupulong sa kurso ng mga taon. Si Paul Gottfried, sino ang unang lumikha ng termino, Peter Brimelow, Richard Lynn, Jared Taylor, John Derbyshire, Steve Sailer at Richard Spencer. Gayundin, ang pangalan at minahan ni Sean Gabb ay madalas na nabanggit na may kaugnayan sa Alt-Right, at ang aking trabaho ay na-link din sa malapit na kaugnay ng kilusang neo-reaksyunaryong inspirasyon ni Curtis Yarvin [^6] at ang kanya na wala na ngayon na blog *Hindi Kwalipikadong Pagpapareserba*. Sa kabuuan, ang mga personal na relasyon at asosasyon ay nakakuha sa akin ng ilang mga marangal na pagbanggit sa pamamagitan ng pinakabantog na ligaw na ligaw-at-kasuklam-suklam na liga ng Amerika, ang SPLC [^7].

Ngayon: Paano ang tungkol sa relasyon sa pagitan ng libertarianism at ang Alt-Right at ang aking mga dahilan sa pag-imbita ng mga nangungunang kinatawan ng Alt-Karapatan sa mga pagpupulong sa mga libertarians? Ang mga Libertaryan ay nagkakaisa ng hindi mapasisinungaling teoretikal na mga ubod ng paniniwala na nabanggit sa pasimula. Ang mga ito ay malinaw tungkol sa layunin na nais nilang makamit. Ngunit ang libertarian na doktrina ay hindi nagpapahiwatig ng anumang bagay *tungkol sa* mga tanong na ito:

1. Kung paano mapanatili ang isang libertaryan kaayusan kapag nakamit;
2. Paano makamit ang isang libertarian order mula sa isang non-libertarian starting point, na nangangailangan ng: 
    1. Iyon ay dapat tama na ilarawan ang panimulang punto;
    2. Tukuyin ng tama ang mga hadlang na ibinabanta sa paraan ng libertaryan na dulo ng ito sa pamamagitan ng napaka panimulang punto na ito.

Upang sagutin ang mga tanong na ito, bukod pa sa teorya, kailangan mo rin ng ilang kaalaman sa sikolohiya ng tao at sosyolohiya o hindi bababa sa isang maliit na bahagi ng karaniwang kahulugan. Gayon pa man maraming libertarians at pekeng libertarians ang malinaw na walang pinag-aralan sa sikolohiya ng tao at sosyolohiya o kahit wala ng anumang sentido komun. Pikit mata silang tumatanggap, laban sa lahat ng mga katibayan ng empirical, ang isang halimaw, blangko-slate na pagtingin sa kalikasan ng tao, ng lahat ng tao at lahat ng lipunan at kultura na totoong pantay at mapagpapalit.

Habang ang karamihan sa mga kontemporaryong libertarianism ay maaaring nailalarawan, pagkatapos, bilang teorya at theorists walang sikolohiya at sosyolohiya, magkano o kahit na ang karamihan sa mga Alt-Karapatan ay maaaring inilarawan, sa kaibahan, bilang sikolohiya at sosyolohiya na walang teorya. Ang Alt-Righters ay hindi nagkakaisa sa pamamagitan ng isang karaniwang teorya, at wala pang kahawig na pagkakahawig ng isang kanonikal na teksto na tumutukoy sa kahulugan nito. Sa halip, ang Alt-Right ay lubos na nagkakaisa sa paglalarawan nito sa kontemporaryong mundo, at partikular na ang US at ang tinatawag na Western World, at ang pagkilala at pagsusuri ng mga social pathology nito. Sa katunayan, tama na nabanggit na ang Alt-Right ay higit na nagkakaisa kung ano ang laban sa kung ano ito. Ito ay laban sa, at sa katunayan ay napopoot sa isang pagkahilig, ang mga piling tao sa kontrol ng Estado, ang MSM at akademya. Bakit? Sapagkat ang lahat ay nagtataguyod ng panlipunan at patolohiya. Sa gayon, itinataguyod nila, at ang matuwid na pagsalungat sa Alt-Right, egalitarianism, apirmatibong aksyon [^8], multiculturalism, at "libreng" mass immigration bilang isang paraan ng pagdadala ng multiculturalism. Gayundin, ang Alt-Right ay nagpapahiwatig ng lahat ng bagay sa kultura ng Marxism o Gramsciism at lahat ng "pulitikal na kawastuhan" at, estratehikong matalino, iniiwanan ito, nang walang anumang paghingi ng tawad kung ano pa man, lahat ng mga akusasyon ng pagiging racist, sexist, elitist, supremacist, homophobe, xenophobe, atbp., atbp. At ang Alt-Right din ay tumawa bilang walang pag-asa na ang programmatic motto ng mga tinatawag na libertaryan tulad ng mga _Studyante para sa Kalayaan_ [^9] ng "Kapayapaan, Pag-ibig, at Kalayaan," naaangkop na isinalin sa Aleman sa pamamagitan ng Lichtschlag bilang "Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen." Sa kaibahan nito, pinilit ng Alt-Righters na ang buhay ay tungkol sa alitan, poot, pakikibaka at labanan, hindi lamang sa pagitan ng mga indibidwal kundi pati na rin sa iba't ibang grupo ng mga taong kumikilos sa konsyerto. "Ang _Millennial Woes" ​​_ [^10] ay lubos na summarized sa Alt-Right:

> Ang pagkakapantay-pantay ay kalokohan. Mahalaga ang hierarchy. Iba-iba ang lahi. Iba't ibang mga kasarian. Ang mga bagay na moral at ang pagkabulok ay totoo. Ang lahat ng kultura ay hindi pantay-pantay at hindi tayo obligado na isipin na sila ay. Ang tao ay isang nilalang na bumagsak at mayroong higit sa buhay kaysa sa guwang na materyalismo. Sa wakas, mahalaga ang puting lahi, at ang kabihasnan ay mahalaga. Ito ang Alt-Right.

Wala nang anumang nagkakaisang teorya, gayunpaman, may mas kaunting kasunduan sa pagitan ng Alt-Right tungkol sa layunin na sa wakas ay nais na makamit. Marami sa mga nangungunang ilaw nito ay may mga malinaw na libertarian leanings, lalo na ang mga dumating dito [^11], kahit na sila ay hindi 100%-ers at hindi makilala ang kanilang sarili bilang tulad. Ang lahat ng mga Alt-Righters na lumitaw dito, halimbawa, ay pamilyar si Rothbard sa kanyang trabaho, samantalang ang pinakahuling kandidato ng Libertarian party para sa pagiging Pangulo ay hindi kailanman narinig ang pangalan ni Rothbard, at lahat ng ito, ay abot ng aking kaalaman, at walang pigil na mga tagasuporta ni Ron Paul sa panahon ng kanyang pangunahing kampanya para sa nominasyon ng Republika ng Partido bilang kandidato para sa pagkapangulo, habang ang maraming mga self-proclaimed libertarians ay sinalakay at sinubukan na siraan si Ron Paul para sa kanyang parang- alam mo na kung ano ang darating sa ngayon - pananaw ng "rasista".

Gayunpaman, ang ilan sa mga lider ng Alt-Right at marami sa mga ranggo at file na tagasunod nito ay nagtataguyod din ng mga pananaw na hindi tugma sa libertarianism. Bilang Buchanan bago at Trump ngayon, matigas ang mga ito tungkol sa pagtupad sa isang patakaran ng mahigpit, mataas na pumipili at nagpapanggap na imigrasyon [^12] na may isang patakaran ng strident ng restricted trade, proteksyon sa ekonomiya at mga proteksyon na taripa [^13].[^14]

Ang iba ay naliligaw pa sa ibang lugar, tulad ni Richard Spencer, na unang nagpapakilala sa terminong Alt-Right. Samantala, dahil sa ilang mga kamakailang mga pampublikong stunt, na nakakuha sa kanya ng ilang antas ng pagkilala sa Estados Unidos, inilagay ni Spencer ang ranggo ng pinakamataas na lider ng isang napakalakas na kilusang pinag-isa [^15]. Nang lumabas si Spencer dito, ilang taon na ang nakalilipas, nagpakita pa rin siya ng mga malalakas na libertarian leanings. Sa kasamaang palad, gayunpaman, ito ay nagbago at tinututulan ngayon ni Spencer, nang walang anumang kwalipikasyon, lahat ng mga libertaryan at lahat ng libertaryan at nawala hanggang sa kahit na ilagay sa sosyalismo, hangga't ito ay sosyalismo ng at para lamang sa puting tao. Anong nakakatakot na pagkabigo!

Dahil sa kakulangan ng anumang panteorya na pundasyon, ang paghihiwalay ng kilusang Alt-Right sa mga karibal na paksyon ay maaaring hindi maituturing na isang sorpresa. Ngunit ang katotohanang ito ay hindi dapat ipaalam sa isa upang bale-walain ito, sapagkat ang Alt-Right ay nagdala ng maraming mga pananaw na mahalaga sa pagharap sa isang sagot sa dalawang naunang nabanggit na mga tanong na hindi sinasagot ng libertaryan teorya: kung paano mapanatili ang isang libertaryan kaayusan sa lipunan at kung paano makarating sa gayong pagkakasunod-sunod mula sa kasalukuyang, tiyak na un-libertarian status quo. Ang Alt-Right ay hindi natuklasan ng mga pananaw na ito. Sila ay itinatag ng matagal na bago at sa katunayan, sa malalaking bahagi sila ay hindi higit sa karaniwang kahulugan. Ngunit sa mga kamakailan-lamang na panahon ang mga pananaw na inilibing sa ilalim ng mga bundok ng egalitarian, leftist propaganda at ang Alt-Kanan ay dapat na kredito para sa nagdala sa kanila pabalik sa liwanag.

Upang ilarawan ang kahalagahan ng mga pananaw na ito, hayaan mong kunin muna ang unang tanong na hindi nasagot.

Maraming mga libertaryan ang may pananaw na ang lahat ng iyon ay kinakailangan upang mapanatili ang isang libertarian order sa lipunan ay ang mahigpit na pagpapatupad ng prinsipyo ng di-agresyon (NAP). Kung hindi, hangga't ang isang abstain mula sa pagsalakay, ayon sa kanilang pagtingin, ang prinsipyo ng "mabuhay at hayaang mabuhay" ay dapat hawakan. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control[^16], and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does *not* hold and apply, or rather it is *insufficient*, when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.

A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave.

The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.

And moreover: Just as a libertarian order must always be on guard against “bad” (even if non-aggressive) neighbors by means of social ostracism, i.e., by a common “you are *not* welcome here” culture, so, and indeed even more vigilantly so, must it be guarded against neighbors who openly advocate communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy in any shape or form. They, in thereby posing an open threat to all private property and property owners, must not only be shunned, but they must, to use a by now somewhat famous Hoppe-meme, be “physically removed,” if need be by violence, and forced to leave for other pastures. Not to do so inevitably leads to – well, communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy and hence, the very opposite of a libertarian social order.

With these “rightist” or as I would say, plain commonsensical insights in mind I turn now to the more challenging question of how to move from here, the *status quo*, to there. And for this it might be instructive to first briefly consider the answer given by the liberallala, the peace-love-and-liberty, the Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen or the capitalism-is-love libertarians. It reveals the same fundamental egalitarianism, if in a slightly different form, as that exhibited also by the live-and-let-live libertarians. These, as I have just tried to show, define what we may call the “bad neighbor problem” – and what is merely a short-hand for the general problem posed by the co-existence of distinctly different, alien, mutually disturbing, annoying, strange or hostile cultures – simply out of existence. And indeed, if you assume, against all empirical evidence, that all people, everywhere, are essentially the same, then, by definition, no such thing as a “bad neighbor problem” exists.

The same egalitarian, or as the liberallala-libertarians themselves prefer call it, “humanitarian” spirit also comes to bear in their answer to the question of a libertarian *strategy*. In a nutshell, their advice is this: be nice and talk to everyone – and then, in the long run, the better libertarian arguments will win out. To illustrate, take my former-friend-turned-foe Jeffrey Tucker’s five “Don’ts When Talking Liberty.” They are:

1. don’t be belligerent;
2. don’t presume hatred of liberty; 
3. don’t presume different goals;
4. don’t presume ignorance;
5. don’t regard anyone as an enemy.”

Now, quite apart from the fact that Tucker does not seem to follow his own advice in his belligerent condemnation of the entire Alt-Right as liberty-hating fascists, I find his exhortations truly astounding. They may be good advice vis-à-vis people just sprung up from nowhere, without any traceable history whatsoever, but vis-à-vis real people with a recorded history they strike me as hopelessly naïve, unrealistic, and outright counterproductive in the pursuit of libertarian ends. For I (and I assume everyone else here) know of and have met many people in my life who *are* ignorant, who *do* have different, un-libertarian goals, and who *do* hate liberty as understood by libertarians – and why in the world should I *not* regard such people as fools or enemies? And why should I *not* hate and *not* be belligerent vis-a-vis my enemies?

As a libertarian strategy, then, Tucker’s advice must be considered simply a bad joke. But surely it is good advice if one seeks entry into the State as some sort of “libertarian” advisor, and this may well explain the enthusiasm with which Tucker’s “humanitarian” libertarianism has been embraced by the entire liberallala-libertarian crowd.

Outside egalitarian phantasy lands, however, in the real world, libertarians must above all be *realistic* and recognize from the outset, as the Alt-Right does, the inequality not just of individuals but also of different cultures as an ineradicable *datum* of the human existence. We must further recognize that there exist plenty of enemies of liberty as defined by libertarianism and that they, not we, are in charge of worldly affairs; that in many parts of the contemporary world their control of the populace is so complete that the ideas of liberty and of a libertarian social order are practically unheard of or considered unthinkable[^18]; and that it is essentially only in the West, in the countries of Western and Central Europe and the lands settled by its people, that the idea of liberty is so deeply rooted that these enemies still can be openly challenged. And confining our strategic considerations here only to the West, then, we can identify, pretty much as the Alt-Right has effectively done, these actors and agencies as our principal enemies.

They are:

1. The ruling elites in control of the State apparatus and in particular the “Deep State” or the so-called “Cathedral” of the military, the secret services, the central banks and the supreme courts. As well, they include: 
    1. The leaders of the military-industrial complex, i.e., of nominally private firms that owe their very existence to the State as the exclusive or dominant buyer of their products;
    2. The leaders of the big commercial banks, which owe their privilege of creating money and credit out of thin air to the existence of the central bank and its role as a “lender of last resort”. They together, then, State, Big-Business and Big-Banking, form an extremely powerful even if tiny “mutual admiration society,” jointly ripping off the huge mass of tax-payers and living it up big time at their expense.
2. ([A] much larger group of enemies is made up of) the intellectuals, educators and “educrats,” from the highest levels of academia down to the level of elementary schools and kindergartens. Funded almost exclusively, whether directly or indirectly, by the State, they, in their overwhelming majority, have become the soft tools and willing executioners in the hands of the ruling elite and its designs for absolute power and total control.
3. The journalists of the MSM, as the docile products of the system of “public education,” and the craven recipients and popularizers of government “information.”

Equally important in the development of a libertarian strategy then is the immediately following next question: who are the *victims*? The standard libertarian answer to this is: the tax-*payers* as opposed to the tax-*consumers*. Yet while this is essentially correct, it is at best only part of the answer, and libertarians could learn something in this respect from the Alt-Right: because apart from the narrowly economic aspect there is also a wider cultural aspect that must be taken into account in identifying the victims.

In order to expand and increase its power, the ruling elites have been conducting for many decades what Pat Buchanan has identified as a systematic “culture war,” aimed at a trans-valuation of all values and the destruction of all natural, or if you will “organic” social bonds and institutions such as families, communities, ethnic groups and genealogically related nations, so as to create an increasingly atomized populace, whose only shared characteristic and unifying bond is its common existential dependency on the State. The first step in this direction, taken already half a century or even longer ago, was the introduction of “public welfare” and “social security.” Thereby, the underclass and the elderly were turned into State-dependents and the value and importance of family and community was correspondingly diminished and weakened. More recently, further-reaching steps in this direction have proliferated. A new “victimology” has been proclaimed and promoted. Women, and in particular single mothers, Blacks, Browns, Latinos, homosexuals, lesbians, bi- and transsexuals have been awarded “victim” status and accorded legal privileges through non-discrimination or affirmative action decrees. As well, most recently such privileges have been expanded also to foreign-national immigrants, whether legal or illegal, insofar as they fall into one of the just mentioned categories or are members of non-Christian religions such as Islam, for instance. The result? Not only has the earlier mentioned “bad neighbor problem” not been avoided or solved, but systematically promoted and intensified instead. Cultural homogeneity has been destroyed, and the freedom of association, and the voluntary physical segregation and separation of different people, communities, cultures and traditions has been replaced by an all-pervasive system of forced social integration. Moreover, each mentioned “victim” group has thus been pitted against every other, and all of them have been pitted against white, heterosexual, Christian males and in particular those married and with children as the only remaining, legally un-protected group of alleged “victimizers.” Hence, as the result of the trans-valuation of all values promoted by the ruling elites, the world has been turned upside down. The institution of a family household with father, mother and their children that has formed the basis of Western civilization, as the freest, most industrious, ingenious and all-around accomplished civilization known to mankind, i.e., the very institution and people that has done most good in human history, has been officially stigmatized and vilified as the source of all social ills and made the most heavily disadvantaged, even persecuted group by the enemy elites’ relentless policy of *divide et impera*.

Accordingly, given the present constellation of affairs, then, any promising libertarian strategy must, very much as the Alt-Right has recognized:

1. Be tailored and addressed to this group of the most severely victimized people. White married Christian couples with children, in particular if they belong also to the class of tax-*payers* (rather than tax-consumers), and everyone most closely resembling or aspiring to this standard form of social order and organization can be realistically expected to be the most receptive audience of the libertarian message[^19]. Given this constellation of perpetrator-enemies vs. victims in the contemporary West, then, I can now come to the final task of trying to outline a realistic libertarian strategy for change. The specifics of which will have to be prefaced by two general considerations. For one, given that the class of intellectuals from the tops of *academia* to the opinion-molding journalists in the MSM are funded by and firmly tied into the ruling system, i.e., that they are a part of the *problem*, they also should not be expected to play a major if any role in the problem’s *solution*. Accordingly, the so-called Hayekian strategy for social change, that envisions the spread of correct libertarian ideas starting at the top, with the leading philosophers, and then trickling down from there to journalists and finally to the great unwashed masses, must be considered fundamentally unrealistic. Instead, any realistic libertarian strategy for change must be a *populist* strategy. That is, libertarians must short-circuit the dominant intellectual elites and address the masses directly to arouse their indignation and contempt for the ruling elites.
2. All the while the main addressees of a populist libertarian message must be indeed the just mentioned groups of dispossessed and disenfranchised native whites, I believe it to be a serious strategic error to make “whiteness” the exclusive criterion on which to base one’s strategic decisions, as some strands of the Alt-Right have suggested to do. After all, it is above all white men that make up the ruling elite and that have foisted the current mess upon us. True enough, the various protected “minorities” mentioned before take full advantage of the legal privileges they have been accorded and they have become increasingly emboldened to ask for ever more “protection,” but none of them and all of them together did not and do not possess the intellectual prowess that would have made this outcome possible, if it were not for the instrumental help that they received and are receiving from white men.

Now, taking our cues from the Buchanan-, the Paul- and the Trump-movement, on to the specifics of a populist strategy for libertarian change, in no specific order except for the very first one, which has currently assumed the greatest urgency in the public mind.

#### Stop mass immigration

The waves of immigrants currently flooding the Western world have burdened it with hordes of welfare parasites, brought in terrorists, increased crime, led to the proliferation of no-go areas and resulted in countless “bad neighbors” who, based on their alien upbringing, culture and traditions, lack any understanding and appreciation of liberty and are bound to become mindless future supporters of welfare-Statism.

No one is against immigration and immigrants *per se*. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments. To ensure this, they or their inviting party must place a bond with the community in which they are to settle, and which is to be forfeited and lead to the immigrant’s deportation should he ever become a public burden. As well, every immigrant, inviting party or employer should not only pay for the immigrant’s upkeep or salary, but must also pay the residential community for the additional wear and tear of its public facilities associated with the immigrant’s presence, so as to avoid the socialization of any and all costs incurred with his settlement. Moreover, even before his admission, every potential immigrant invitee must be carefully screened and tested not only for his productivity but also for cultural affinity (or “good neighborliness”) – with the empirically predictable result of mostly, but by no means exclusively, western-white immigrant-candidates. And any known communist or socialist, of any color, denomination or country of origin, must be barred from permanent settlement – unless, that is, the community where the potential immigrant wants to settle officially sanctions the looting of its residents’ property by new, foreign arrivals, which is not very likely to say the least (even within already existing ‘commie’ communes).[^20]

#### Stop attacking, killing and bombing people in foreign countries

A main cause, even if by no means the only one, for the current invasion of Western countries by hordes of alien immigrants, are the wars initiated and conducted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the US’ ruling elites and their subordinate Western puppet-elites. As well, the by now seemingly ‘normal’ and ubiquitous terrorist attacks in the name of Islam across the Western world are in large measure the “blow-back” of these wars and the ensuing chaos throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. There should be no hesitation to call these Western rulers what they are: murderers or accessories to mass murder. We must demand, and cry out loud instead for a foreign policy of strict non-interventionism. Withdraw from all international and supranational organizations such as the UN, NATO and the EU that intricate one country into the domestic affairs of another. Stop all government-to-government aid and prohibit all weapon sales to foreign States. Let it be *America First!, England First!, Germany First!, Italy First!*, and so on, i.e., each country trading with one another and no one interfering in anyone else’s domestic affairs.

#### Defund the ruling elites and its intellectual bodyguards

Expose and widely publicize the lavish salaries, perks, pensions, side-deals, bribes and hush monies received by the ruling elites: by the higher-ups in government and governmental bureaucracies, of supreme courts, central banks, secret services and spy agencies, by politicians, parliamentarians, party leaders, political advisors and consultants, by crony-capitalists, “public educrats,” university presidents, provosts and academic “stars.” Drive home the point that all their shining glory and luxury is funded by money extorted from tax-payers, and consequently urge that any and all taxes be slashed: income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., etc..

#### End the FED and all central banks

The second source of funding for the ruling elites, besides the money extorted from the public in the form of taxes, comes from the central banks. Central banks are allowed to create paper money out of thin air. This reduces the purchasing power of money and destroys the savings of average people. It does not and cannot make society as a whole richer, but it redistributes income and wealth within society. The earliest receivers of the newly created money, i.e., the ruling elites, are thereby made richer and the later and latest receivers, i.e., the average citizen, are made poorer. The central bank’s manipulation of interest rates is the cause of boom-bust cycles. The central bank permits the accumulation of ever greater “public debt” that is shifted as a burden onto unknown future taxpayers or is simply inflated away. And as the facilitator of public debt, the central banks are also the facilitators of wars. This monstrosity must end and be replaced by a system of free, competitive banking built on the foundation of a genuine commodity money such as gold or silver.

#### Abolish all ‘affirmative action’ and ‘non-discrimination’ laws and regulations

All such edicts are blatant violations of the principle of the equality before the law that, at least in the West, is intuitively sensed and recognized as a fundamental principle of justice. As private property owners, people must be free to associate or disassociate with others: to include or exclude, to integrate or segregate, to join or separate, to unify and incorporate or to disunite, exit and secede. Close all university departments for Black-, Latino-, Women-, Gender-, Queer-Studies, etc., etc., as incompatible with science and dismiss its faculties as intellectual imposters or scoundrels. As well, demand that all affirmative action commissars, diversity and human resources officers, from universities on down to schools and kindergartens, be thrown out onto the street and be forced to learn some useful trade.

#### Crush the “Anti-Fascist” Mob

The trans-valuation of all values throughout the West: the invention of ever more “victim groups,” the spread of “affirmative action” programs and the relentless promotion of “political correctness,” has led to the rise of an “anti-fascist” mob. Tacitly supported and indirectly funded by the ruling elites, this self-described mob of “social justice warriors” has taken upon itself the task of escalating the fight against “white privilege” through deliberate acts of terror directed against anyone and anything deemed “racist,” “right-wing,” “fascist,” “reactionary,” “incorrigible” or “unreconstructed.” Such “enemies of progress” are physically assaulted by the “anti-fascist” mob, their cars are burnt down, their properties vandalized, and their employers threatened to dismiss them and ruin their careers – all the while the police are ordered by the powers that be to “stand down” and not to investigate the crimes committed or prosecute and punish the criminals. In view of this outrage, public anger must be aroused and there must be clamoring, far and wide, for the police to be unleashed and this mob be beaten into submission.[^21]

#### Crush the street criminals and gangs

In dispensing with the principle of the equality before the law and awarding all sorts of group privileges (except to the one group of married white Christian men and their families) the ruling elites have also dispensed with the principle of equal punishment for equal crime. Some State-favored groups are handed more lenient punishment for the same crime than others, and some especially favored groups are simply let run wild and go practically unpunished at all, thus actually and effectively promoting crime. As well, no-go areas have been permitted to develop where any effort at law-enforcement has essentially ceased to exist and where violent thugs and street gangs have taken over. In view of this, public furor must be provoked and it be unmistakably demanded that the police crack-down quick and hard on any robber, mugger, rapist and murderer, and ruthlessly clear all current no-go areas of violent gang-rule. Needless to say that this policy should be colorblind, but if it happens to be, as it in fact does, that most street criminals or gang members are young Black or Latino males or, in Europe, young immigrant males from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans or Eastern Europe, then so be it and such human specimen then should be the ones that most prominently get their noses bloodied. And needless to say also that in order to defend against crime, whether ordinary street crime or acts of terrorism, all prohibitions against the ownership of guns by upstanding citizen should be abolished.

#### Get rid of all welfare parasites and bums

To cement their own position, the ruling class has put the underclass on the dole and thus made it a most reliable source of public support. Allegedly to help people rise and move up from the underclass to become self-supporting actors, the real – and actually intended – effect of the State’s so-called “social policy” is the exact opposite. It has rendered a person’s underclass status more permanent and made the underclass steadily grow (and with this also the number of tax-funded social workers and therapists assigned to “help and assist” it). For, in accordance with inexorable economic law, every subsidy awarded on account of some alleged need or deficiency produces more, not less, of the problem that it is supposed to alleviate or eliminate. Thus, the root cause of a person’s underclass status: his low impulse control and high time preference, i.e., his uncontrolled desire for immediate gratification, and the various attendant manifestations of this cause, such as unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, divorce, female headed households, out-of-wedlock births, rotating shack-up male companions, child abuse, negligence and petty crime, is and are not alleviated or eliminated but systematically strengthened and promoted. Instead of continuing and expanding this increasingly unsightly social disaster, then, it should be abolished and be loudly demanded that one take heed of the biblical exhortation that he who can, but will not work, also shall not eat, and that he who truly cannot work, due to severe mental or physical deficiencies, be taken care of by family, community and voluntary charity.

#### Get the State out of education

Most, if not all, social pathologies plaguing the contemporary West have their common root in the institution of “public education.” When the first steps were taken, more than two centuries ago, in Prussia, to supplement and ultimately replace a formerly completely private system of education with a universal system of compulsory “public education,” the time spent in State-run schools did in most cases not exceed four years. Today, throughout the entire Western world, the time spent in institutions of “public education” is, at a minimum, around ten years, and in many cases, and increasingly so, twenty or even thirty years. That is, a large or even the largest part of time during the most formative period in a person’s life is spent in State-funded and State-supervised institutions, whose primary purpose from the very beginning it was *not* to raise an enlightened public, but to train “good soldiers” and “good public servants:” not independent and mature or “mündige Bürger,” but subordinate and servile “Staats-Bürger.” The result? The indoctrination has worked: the longer the time a person has spent within the system of public education, the more he is committed to leftist-egalitarian ideas and has swallowed and wholeheartedly internalized the official doctrine and agenda of “political correctness.” Indeed, in particular among social science teachers and professors, people *not* counting themselves as part of the Left have practically ceased to exist. Consequently, it must be demanded that the control of schools and universities be wrest away from the central State and, in a first step, be returned to regional or better still local and locally funded authorities, and ultimately be completely privatized, so as to replace a system of compulsory uniformity and conformity with a system of decentralized education that reflects the natural variation, multiplicity and diversity of human talents and interests.

#### Don’t put your trust in politics or political parties

Just as *academia* and the academic world cannot be expected to play any significant role in a libertarian strategy for social change, so with politics and political parties – after all, it is the ultimate goal of libertarianism to put an end to all politics, and to subject all interpersonal relations and conflicts to private law and civil law procedures. To be sure, under present, all-pervasively politicized conditions an involvement in politics and party politics cannot be entirely avoided. However, in any such involvement one must be keenly aware of and guard against the corrupting influence of power and the lure of money and perks that comes with it. And to minimize this risk and temptation, it is advisable to concentrate one’s efforts on the level of regional and local rather than national politics, and there to promote a radical agenda of decentralization: of nullification and peaceful separation, segregation and secession. Most importantly, however, we must take heed of Ludwig von Mises’ life-motto: Do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it. That is, we must speak out whenever and wherever, whether in formal or informal gatherings, against anyone affronting us with by now only all-too-familiar “politically correct” drivel and left-egalitarian balderdash and unmistakably say: “No. Hell no. You must be kidding.” In the meantime, given the almost complete mind-control exercised by the ruling elites, *academia* and the MSM, it already requires a good portion of courage to do so. But if we are not brave enough to do so now and thus set an example for others to follow, matters will become increasingly worse and more dangerous in the future, and we, Western civilization and the Western ideas of freedom and liberty will be wiped out and vanish.

[^20]: Brief message to all open-border and liberallala libertarians, who will surely label this, you guessed it, “fascist”: In a fully privatized libertarian order there exists no such thing as a right to free immigration. Private property implies borders and the owner’s right to exclude at will. And “public property” has borders as well. It is not unowned. It is the property of domestic tax-payers and most definitely not the property of foreigners. And while it is true that the State is a criminal organization and that to entrust it with the task of border control will inevitably result in numerous injustices to both domestic residents and foreigners, it is also true that the State *does something* also when it decides *not* to do anything about border control and that, under the present circumstances, doing nothing at all in this regard will lead to even more and much graver injustices, in particular to the domestic citizenry.

[^21]: Query for liberallala-libertarians and the Stupids for Liberty, who are sure to object to this demand on the ground that the police asked to crush the “anti-fascist” mob are *State-_police: Do you also object, on the same grounds, that the police arrest murderers or rapists? Aren’t these legitimate tasks performed also in any libertarian order by _private* police? And if the police are not to do anything about this mob, isn’t it o.k. then that the target of its attacks, the “racist Right,” should take the task upon itself of giving the “social justice warriors” a bloody nose?
