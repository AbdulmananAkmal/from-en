## Ang pagsubok: Panloloko

Tama sa gilid ng kung ano ang karaniwang itinuturing na etikal ang sitwasyon sa hamon ng *pandaraya*.

Ang panloloko ay ang pagkuha ng halaga sa pamamagitan ng maling representasyon. Kung sasabihin ko sa iyo na ipapadala ko sa iyo ang iPod kung bibigyan mo ako ng dalawang daang dolyar, at pagkatapos ay dalhin ang iyong pera nang walang pinapadala sa iyo ng iPod, agad nating mauunawaan na ito ay isang anyo ng pagnanakaw.

Ilagay natin ang problema ng pandaraya sa pamamagitan ng gilingan ng UPB, at tingnan kung may hawak ito.

Malinaw, ang panloloko ay nangangailangan ng isang tao *hindi* ay nakikibahagi sa pandaraya. Sa itaas na potensyal na transaksyon, kung ako ay umaasa na nakawin ang iyong dalawang daang dolyar, at umaasa ka na nakawin ang aking iPod, walang darating dito. Hinihiling mo ang iPod bago magbigay ng pagbabayad, at ako ay humihingi ng bayad bago ibigay ang iPod. Magiging mapangalagaan tayo, lubos na hindi makapanlinlang sa bawat isa.

Malinaw,, dahil sa pandaraya ay magaganap, ang isang partido ay dapat kumilos nang may mabuting pananampalataya. Kaya ang taong nagnanais na gumawa ng pandaraya ay nakasalalay sa katotohanan na ang ibang tao ay gumagawa *hindi* nais na gumawa ng pandaraya, upang hulihin siya.

To return to our hapless moral guinea pigs, what would happen if we asked Bob and Doug to act on the moral principle that “fraud is good”? If Doug has twenty dollars, and Bob has a lighter, and Doug offers Bob twenty dollars for that lighter, and then takes the lighter but does not give Bob the twenty dollars, then Doug has been acting on the premise that fraud is good.

What happens then?

Clearly, the principle that “fraud is good” cannot be acted on by both Doug and Bob simultaneously – since in order to commit fraud, Doug must act dishonestly, and Bob must act honestly. Thus to enable Doug’s “moral” action, Bob must act “immorally.”

UPB destroys this possibility, since no valid moral theory can require opposite actions under the same circumstances.

If Doug commits fraud on Bob with the justification that “it is good to lie to get what you want,” then clearly it must also be good to be honest as well, since it is impossible to get what you want by lying unless other people are willing to assume your honesty. Thus the premise that it is good to lie to get what you want cannot be achieved unless other people act with integrity – thus lying and honesty are simultaneously required for the fulfilment of the moral principle. This cannot logically stand – that both an action *and its complete opposite* are simultaneously moral in the same place, for the same people, and at the same time.

This is how we know that fraud is wrong.

Again, knowing that fraud is “wrong” simply means that we know that any moral theory that justifies fraud is invalid, because it is self-contradictory. If we build a bridge, and the bridge falls down, we know that the bridge was “wrong” – but the most important thing that we can learn from this disaster is not that the bridge fell down, but to understand the flaws in the theory that caused us to build a bridge that fell down. Similarly, moral theories that cause disasters, such as communism, fascism and Nazism, are important to evaluate relative to UPB not only so we can understand how they went so wrong, but also how to fix our moral theories in the future. Since as a species, we will be forever building bridges, it is essential that we get our facts and theories right, or they will endlessly fall down around us.

However, the question remains whether fraud is evil, or just an aesthetically negative action (ANA).

Fraud is unusual compared to rape, theft and murder, insofar as it requires that the victim act positively to participate in the process. I can jump up behind you and strangle you without any participation on your part, but I cannot defraud you unless you participate to some degree. Thus fraud falls under the umbrella of “avoidability,” and so is in a fundamentally different category than rape, murder and theft. However, the degree of avoidability partly determines the degree of immorality involved. Sending your bank information to a Nigerian email spammer is certainly avoidable; being cheated by an eBay business with a perfect rating is far less avoidable.

There may be certain situations under which fraud is unavoidable, such as “bartering” for a life-saving medicine when no alternative exists, but that falls under the “grey area” that we have discussed above – these occurrences are so rare that they are to ethics as mutations are to biological species.
