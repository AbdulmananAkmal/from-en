## Ang pagdalaw muli sa Wlang daan

Sa simula ng aklat na ito, inilalagay ko sa isang paraan ng pagtingin at paano naproproseso ang katotohanan, pagkakatulad nito sa pisika. Mula sa "maliliit na katotohanan" sa pagsalo sa isang baseball, dumating tayo sa"dakilang katotohanan" ng pisika - at ang dakilang katotohanan ay hindi salungat sa mga lailiit na katotohanan.

Ang parehong ito ng moralidad. Mula sa maliliit na katotohanan ng "hindi ako dapat pumaslang" makakapunta tayo sa dakilang katotohanan tulad ng sa "ang pagsisimula sa paggamit ng puwersa ay moral na hindi tama."

Sa lupain ng pisika, naging pangunahing hadlang sa lohikal na pagkakaintindi ng katotohanan mula sa personal na karanasan sa unibersal na teyorya ay ang relihiyon.

Halimbawa, walang tao ang direktang nakakaranas ng perpektong bilog - katulad ng nilalang na umiiral sa abstrak, at sa matematika, ngunit alinman ay hindi makikita sa isip, o kaya sa magalang na karanasan sa tunay na mundo. Wala kahit saan sa kalikasan, sa ating kaalaman, ang mayroong perpektong bilig na umiiral, kahit sa "maliit na katotohanan" ng sariling karanasan, o kaya sa "dakilang katotohanan" ng pisika.

Gayunman, para sa libu-libong taon, ang siyensiya ng astronomiya ay gumagapang sa paghahanap para sa mga "perpektong bilog." Ang orbit na pangplaneta ay mayroon perpektong bilog, dahil ang Diyos ay hindi hahayan ang anumang bagay bilang "hindi perpekto" bilang isang tambilugan sa kanyang paglikha.

Ang problema sa ganitong paraan, mabuti, ay isang problema parin - ay ang pabago-bago na paggalaw ng Mars. Mula sa ating planeta, Ang Mars ay minsan parang gumagalaw "pabalik" gaya ng sa Mundo "maabutan" sa paligid ng araw. The false belief that the Earth was the centre of the solar system, combined with a mania for “perfect” circles, produced the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, which multiplied all of these perfect circles to the point of absurdity, in order to take into account elliptical orbits and the retrograde motion of Mars.

Why was this illusion of perfection considered to be a requirement for celestial bodies? Certainly the evidence of the moon, with its pitted and cratered surface, would seem to support the imperfection of the heavens, but religious fixations bypassed the direct sensual evidence of both immediate and interplanetary imperfections. Galileo’s discoveries of moon-mountains, sunspots and Jupiter’s moons were all attacked as heretical.

Maaari din namin itong pag-aralan sa tanong ng pag-iiral ng Diyos.

We have no direct, empirical or rational evidence for the existence of God. The most abstract scientific measurements provide no evidence for the existence of God either – yet in between the truth of our own experience, which is that there is no God, and the most abstract scientific measurements and theories – which also confirm that there is no God – a sort of “null zone” is willed into existence, *which completely inverts any rational standards of truth*.

### Bigotry

Beliefs may be true, false, or *anti-truth*. It is a true belief that the Sahara Desert is in North Africa; it is a false belief that the Sahara is in Scotland; it is an *anti-true* belief that the Sahara is whatever I want it to be, and exists wherever I want it to exist. The first belief is true; the second is false – the third is a bigoted assertion that detonates the very concept of proof.

We can say:

1. Proposition X is true because it is rational.
2. Proposition Y is false because it is irrational.
3. Proposition Z is true because I *want* it to be true.

The third assertion is a complete self-contradiction. “Truth” is independent of desire, since desire is by definition a subjective preference, and truth is by definition the conformity of ideas to the objective standards of logic and empirical reality. Saying that something is true because you *want* it to be true is to equate subjectivity with objectivity, which is a self-contradictory statement.

Bigoted assertions – or “faith” – by definition cannot be tested, since they are not belief in the *absence* of evidence, but belief in *defiance* of reason and/or evidence.

We can believe unproven things that turn out to be true – someone doubtless thought that the world was round before it was proven – but the “null zone” is the realm wherein we cling to a belief in things that *could not possibly turn out to be true*.

If I say that two plus two equals five, I am making a mistake that can be corrected with reference to logic. If I say that I believe that a square circle exists, then I am making an explicitly self-contradictory statement, which disproves itself. If I go further, however, and emphatically claim that “foo plus tury equals desty” – and refuse to define any of my terms – I am making a statement to which logic and evidence *cannot be applied*.

### Next Stop: The "Alternative Universe"

In general, the way that people try to “save” their anti-empirical and anti-logical beliefs is to create an “alternate realm” or “alternate universe” wherein their self-contradictory statements can somehow be true.

If I say: “A square circle exists,” I am asserting that which is clearly impossible within this universe. Thus, if I wish to retain my belief, I must invent some other universe, or realm “outside” this universe where a square circle can exist.

If I make up a realm where self-contradiction equals truth, I can then claim that those who say that a square circle does *not* exist are themselves bigoted and prejudicial, because they are eliminating possibilities that *could* be true.[^1]

With regards to this “null zone,” only two possibilities really exist. Either this *null zone* exists completely independently of our universe, and will never be measurable, detectable or discoverable in any way, shape or form – or, at some point, we shall be able to detect and interact with this magical land where self-contradiction equals truth.

If, at some point, it turns out that we *are* able to interact with this *null zone*, then we shall have direct sensual or rational evidence of its existence. In other words, it must “protrude” into our universe in some manner. However, the moment that it becomes detectable in our universe, it must have rational and empirical existence, like everything else we can detect. Thus these otherworldly “protrusions” into our universe *cannot create the capacity for our universe to support the existence of a square circle*.

We can thus be certain that if we *are* ever able to detect this other universe, the evidence we gather will in no way support the existence of self-contradictory statements. Square circles, gods and other self-contradictory concepts cannot hide there, any more than they can hide in the wet dreams of leprechauns.

On the other hand, if it turns out that we are *never* able to detect this other universe, and it remains a completely theoretical entity, with no evidence or rationality to support it, then it is simply a conceptual bag in which it is “convenient” to place things that are obviously not true.

[^1]: This inevitably ends up with comparisons to those who said that Einsteinian physics was impossible, that the world could not be round and so on. Uncertainty in *content* – i.e. theory – is somehow supposed to be equated with uncertainty in *methodology*, i.e. reason and evidence. The fact that a mathematical theorem can be disproved does not disprove the principles of mathematics, but rather confirms them.
