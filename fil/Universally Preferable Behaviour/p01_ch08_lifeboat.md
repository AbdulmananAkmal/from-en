## Mga pangyayari sa lifeboat

Ang UPB lamang ang nagpapatunay ng mga lohikal na teyorya ng moral ay hindi ibigsabihin na pwedeng walang conceivable circumstances sa ilalim kung saan pwede kang pumili ng iyong act *against*ang tenet ng mga teyorya.

Halimbawa sa, kapag tinanggap natin ang unibersal ng validity of property rights, pag-sira sa bintana at pagtalon sa ibang tao sa apartment ng walang pahintulot ito ay paglabag sa kanyang karapatan sa ari-arian. Gayunman, kung tayo ay nakabitin sa flagpole sa labas ng bintana sa aparment, at tungkol sa mga namatay sa pagkahulog, ang ilan sa atin ay sinipa ang bintama at tumalon para makaligtas alang-alang sa mga pagsunod sa abstrak ng alituntunin.

Sa mundong totoo, ito ay umaabot sa staggeringly callous ng tao sa pagpindot sa mga charge laban sa tao kung sino ang sumisira sa bintana ayon sa utos para mai-save ang kanyang buhay - kagaya ng isang tao na irreponsable na tumanggi na bayaran ang sinira para sa nasabing bintana. Prinsipyo ng "maiwasan" dito ang sentro - ang taong nakabitin sa flagpole ay ang maliit na pagpili tungkol sa pagsiba sa bintana. Ang lalaking sumira sa iyong bahay para kuhain ang mga bagay na malinaw ay may kapasidad na maiwasan ang pag-invading sa iyong ari-arian - hindi sya cornered, pero sa halip na *initiator* sa pananalakay. Ito ay kagaya sa mga pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng babae kung sinong tao ang nandadaya sa kanya, laban sa babae kung sinong tao ang nag-sarado sa kanya sa basement.

Ito ay hindi na sabihin na ang pagsira sa bintana para iligtas ang iyong buhay ay hindi mali. Ito ay, pero ito ay mali na halos ang lahat sa atin ang piliin na magpursige sa halip na mamatay. If I were on the verge of starving to death, I would steal an apple. This does not mean that it is *right* for me to steal the apple – it just means that I would do it – and must justly accept the consequences of my theft.[^10]

### Grey Areas

The fact that certain “grey areas” exist in the realm of ethics has often been used as a justification for rank relativism. Since on occasion some things remain unclear (e.g. who initiated the use of violence), and since it is impossible to define objective and exact rules for every conceivable situation, the conclusion is often drawn that nothing can *ever* be known for certain, and that no objective rules exist for *any* situation.

This is false.

All reasonable people recognise that biology is a valid science, despite the fact that some animals are born with “one-off” mutations. The fact that a dog can be born with five legs does not mean that “canine” becomes a completely subjective category. The fact that certain species of insects are challenging to differentiate does not mean that there is no difference between a beetle and a whale.

For some perverse reason, intellectuals in particular take great joy in the wanton destruction of ethical, normative and rational standards. This could be because intellectuals have so often been paid by corrupt classes of individuals such as politicians, priests and kings – or it could be that a man often becomes an intellectual in order to create justifications for his own immoral behaviour. Whatever the reason, most modern thinkers have become a species of “anti-thinker,” which is very odd. It would be equivalent to there being an enormous class of “biologists” who spent their entire lives arguing that the science of biology was impossible. If the science of biology is impossible, it scarcely makes sense to become a biologist, any more than an atheist should fight tooth and nail to become a priest.

### Shades Of Grey

In the realm of “grey areas,” there are really only three possibilities.

1. There are no such things as grey areas.
2. Certain grey areas do exist.
3. All knowledge is a grey area.

Clearly, option one can be easily discarded. Option three is also fairly easy to discard. The statement “all knowledge is a grey area” is a self-detonating proposition, as we have seen above, in the same way that “all statements are lies” also self-detonates.

Thus we must go with option two, which is that certain grey areas do exist, and we know that they are grey relative to the areas that are not grey Oxygen exists in space, and also underwater, but not in a form or quantity that human beings can consume. The *degree* of oxygenation is a grey area, i.e. “less versus more”; the question of whether or not human beings can breathe water is surely black and white.

A scientist captured by cannibals may pretend to be a witch-doctor in order to escape – this does not mean that we must dismiss the scientific method as entirely invalid.

Similarly, there can be extreme situations wherein we may choose to commit immoral actions, but such situations do not invalidate the science of morality, any more than occasional mutations invalidate the science of biology. In fact, the science of biology is greatly advanced through the acceptance and examination of mutations – and similarly, the science of ethics is only strengthened through an examination of “lifeboat scenarios,” as long as such an examination is not pursued obsessively.

### Universality And Exceptions

Before we start using our framework of Universally Preferable Behaviour to examine some commonly held ethical beliefs, we must deal with the question of “exceptions.”

Using the above “lifeboat scenarios,” the conclusion is often drawn that “the good” is simply *that which is “good” for an individual man’s life*.

In ethical arguments, if I am asked whether I would steal an apple rather than starve to death – and I say “yes” – the following argument is inevitably made:

1. Everyone would rather steal an apple than starve to death.
2. Thus everyone universally prefers stealing apples to death by starvation.
3. Thus it is *universally preferable* to steal apples rather than starve to death.
4. Thus survival is universally preferable to property rights.
5. Thus what is good for the individual is the ultimate moral standard.

This has been used as the basis for a number of ethical theories and approaches, from Nietzsche to Rand. The preference of each individual for survival is translated into ethical theories that place the survival of the individual at their centre.[^11]

This kind of “biological hedonism” may be a description of the “drive to survive,” but it is only correct insofar as it describes what people actually *do*, not what they *should* do.

It also introduces a completely unscientific subjectivism to the question of morality. For instance, if it is morally permissible to steal food when you are starving, how much food can you steal? How hungry do you have to be? Can you steal food that is not nutritious? How nutritious does the food have to be in order to justify stealing it? How long after stealing one meal are you allowed to steal another meal? Are you allowed to steal meals rather than look for work or appeal to charity?

Also, if I can make more money as a hit man than a shopkeeper, should I not pursue violence as a career? It certainly enhances *my* survival... and so on and so on.

As we can see, the introduction of “what is good for man in the abstract – or what most people do – is what is universally preferable” destroys the very concept of morality as a logically consistent theory, and substitutes mere biological drives as justifications for behaviour. It is an explanation of behaviour, not a proposed moral theory.

### The Purpose And The Dangers

With your patient indulgence, one final question needs to be addressed before we plunge into a definition and test how various moral propositions fit into the UPB framework. Since the hardest work lies ahead, we should pause for a moment and remind ourselves why we are putting ourselves through all this rigour and difficulty.

In other words, before we plunge on, it is well worth asking the question: “Why bother?”

Why bother with defining ethical theories? Surely good people don’t need them, and bad people don’t consult them. People will do what they prefer, and just make up justifications as needed after the fact – why *bother* lecturing people about morality?

Of course, the danger always exists that an immoral person will attack you for his own hedonistic purposes. It could also be the case that, despite clean and healthy living, you may be struck down by cancer before your time – the former does not make the science of morality irrelevant, any more than the latter makes the sciences of medicine, nutrition and exercise irrelevant. One demonstrable effect of a rational science of morality must be to reduce your chances of *suffering* immoral actions such as theft, murder and rape – and it is by this criterion that we shall also judge the moral rules proposed in Part Three of this book.
