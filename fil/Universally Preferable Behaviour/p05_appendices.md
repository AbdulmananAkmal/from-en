# Ang mga apendiks

## Apendiks A: UPB sa madaling salita

Sa ilalim, pakisausap hanapin ang pangunahing pagbubuod para sa moradlidad.

1. Ang obhetibo ay katotohanan at pare-parehas.
2. "lohika" ay ang hanay ng obhetibo at pare-prehas at mga patakaran na nanggaling sa pare-parehas na katotohanan.
3. Ang mga sumusunod na teyorya sa lohika na tinaguriang "balido."
4. Ang mga teyorya na nakumpimado ng empirical testing ay tinawag na "wasto."
5. Ang mga teyorya ay parehas na balido at wasto na tinawag na "tunay."
6. "ang mga kagustuhan" ang kailangan para sa buhay, ideya, lenggwahe at pagdedebate.
7. Ang mga pagdedebati ay kailangan sa parehong hawak ng partido "totoo" para parehas na maging obhetibo at sa panglahatang kanais-nais.
8. Thus the very act of debating contains an acceptance of universally preferable behaviour (UPB).
9. Theories regarding UPB must pass the tests of logical consistency and empirical verification.
10. The subset of UPB that examines enforceable behaviour is called “morality.”
11. As a subset of UPB, no moral theory can be considered true if it is illogical or unsupported by empirical evidence.
12. Moral theories that are supported by logic and evidence are true. All other moral theories are false.

## Appendix B: Moral Categories

## Appendix D: Every UPB Debate I've Ever Had...

**UPB Sceptic**: UPB is invalid. **Me**: How do you know? **UPB Sceptic**: It's not proven! **Me**: So “proof” is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, nothing is UPB. **Me**: Isn't the statement "nothing is UPB" UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, that's not what I'm saying at all! I'm saying that UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's false! **Me**: So presenting true arguments is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! **Me**: So there's nothing wrong with false arguments? **UPB Sceptic**: No. **Me**: Then why are you opposing a false argument? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh, it's just my personal preference. I just dislike falsehood. **Me**: So you're arguing for a merely personal preference? **UPB Sceptic**: Sure! **Me**: So why should your personal preference take precedence over mine? I like UPB, you don't – and why bother debating personal preferences at all? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh - because UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why is it invalid? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's self-contradictory! **Me**: So consistency is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! And stop repeating the same points over and over! And go read Kant / Hegel / Hume etc.
