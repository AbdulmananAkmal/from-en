## Karagdagang mga Patunay

Mayroong ibang karagdagang mga patunay na kaya nating matiia ang katanungan ng higit na mabuting pagkilos sa lahat ng dako.

### Ang Ekonomiya ng Malayang-Pamilihan

Ang isang malayang pamilihan ay walang duda na pinakamahusay at paraan ng paggawa ng kayamanan ng pagsasaayos ng produksyon at pagkonsumo ng mga kalakal at yaman sa loob ng lipunan. Ang materyal na tagumpay ay walang kapantay sa kasaysayan ng tao, o sa kabuuan ng mundo.

Ang balangkas ng UPB ay umasam, nagpapatunay at nagpaliwanag ng mga dahilan para sa materyal na mga tagumpay ng ekonomiya ng malayang pamilihan.

Sa teorya, ang malayang pamilihan ay base sa aplikasyon ng unibersal na teorya ng karapatan sa ari-arian. Sa kabilang dako, ang komunismo ay base sa malinaw na pagtanggi ng unibersal na teorya ng karapatan sa ari-arian. Since we have proven above that universal property rights is the only valid moral theory, this explains at the most fundamental level why communism is such a disaster, while a free-market economy is so materially productive.

Since human beings *do in fact* have equal rights of property, any social system which rejects this right is doomed to utter failure – just as any bridge planner who rejects the reality of gravity will never be able to build a bridge that stands.

### The Scientific Method

Logic and science are in fact methodologies which exist – along with morality – under the umbrella of UPB. In other words, logic and science are both validated by the framework of UPB.

A central question which needs to be answered is: *why is the scientific method infinitely superior to other “methodologies” of knowledge acquisition, such as mysticism?*

UPB answers this question.

Since any methodology for knowledge acquisition must be universal, consistent, and independent of time and place, the scientific method meets these requirements, while irrational and subjective mysticism is the exact opposite of these requirements.

### Public Education

One central principle of free market economics is that quality only really results from *voluntarism*. Coercion, fundamentally, is inefficient – violence always results in poor quality. The old-style Soviet bakeries never carried good bread; a man who beats his wife will never have a happy marriage.

The initiation of the use of force is always counter to any rational moral theory – it is a specific and explicit violation of UPB. Since public schools are funded through the initiation of the use of force, they are a form of *forced association*, which is a clear violation of the *freedom of association* validated by UPB.

Since force violates the moral requirement of *avoidability* – and a lack of avoidability always breeds poor quality – UPB would help us easily predict that public schools would provide education of low quality.

Furthermore, UPB would also have helped us predict that, as more and more force was used in the realm of public education – as taxes, union compulsions and so on escalated – the quality of the education provided would get worse and worse.

This, of course, was – and is – exactly the case.
