## Mga etika

Dahil ang mga etika ay asignatura na tayong lahat ay mayroon mga ideya tungkol dito, ito ay importanteng mabalangkas sa relasyon nito sa pagitan ng *instinctual*mga etika*makatwiran*mga etika.

Ang manlalaro ng besbol ay pwedeng masalo ang lumilipad na bola kahit wala syang alam ukol sa mga pisika, kaparehas, na paraan, pwede nating maintindihan ng tama ang isang aksyon bilang imoral kahit wala tayong nauunawaan ukol sa mga teyorya ng etika.

Kung sasaluhin ko ang lumilipad na bola, pagkatapos ay meroon akong isang instinctual*madama*para sa kaugalian ng isang besbol sa paglipad. Ang aking maipapahayag na may kalikasan na pagkaka-intindi, gayunman, ako ay hindi binigyan ng kapasidad na tama ang ilunsad ang isang sasakayan napangkalawakan para libutin ang hupiter. Meron akong isang madaliang "kunting katotohanan" -kung paano ang bola ay galawin - subali't hindi ito ipinagkaloob sa akin ng isang unibersal "malaking katotohanan" - kung paano ang mga bagay ay kumilos ng wasto.

Sa parehas na paraan, ang ating pangkaraniwang pagbabago patungo sa mga asksyon na tulad ng panggagahasa at pagpinsala ay hindi ibigsabihin hindi tama, subali't hindi nila tayo binigyan ng kakayanan na gumawa o magpatotoo ng pare-parehas at empirikal na moral ng mga teyorya.

Kapag imungkahi ko na ang isang siyentipiko na ang mga teyorya ay kumpletong magpawalanng-bisa sa abiliadad ng mga manlalaro ng besbol sa pagsalo ng lumilipad na bola, saka ay meroon akong hindi mareresolba na hamon ng pagpapaliwanag kung paano talaga ang manlalaro ng besbol *ay* saluhin ang bola. Pati, kung aking dakilang teyorya ay hindi tama na mahulaan ang arko ng isang bola, meron akong isang "malaking patunay" na kung saan ay diretsong kumokontra sa "maliit na patunay," na pwedeng hindi balido. Dahil sa nangangailangan ng pagkakapare-parehas na lohikal ay diretso galing sa "maliit na patunay" ng perseptwal na karanasan, maski anomang teyorya na direstsong kumokontra sa karanasan ay hindi imbalido.

In other words, the senses give rise to logic – therefore logic cannot contradict the evidence of the senses. Evidence always trumps explanation.

In a similar manner, any valid ethical theory should be able to explain and justify our common revulsion towards crimes such as murder and rape. It cannot reasonably contradict the universal prohibitions of mankind, but must accurately incorporate and explain them.

However, just as Einsteinian physics provided surprising truths – in fact, it would have been of little value if those truths were *not* surprising – ethical theories provide the most value when they also reveal surprising truths – shocking, even. In fact, ethical theories that did not provide surprising truths would be a mere confirmation of existing instinctual preferences, and thus be of little value.

### The Discipline Of Theoretical Ethics

If I say that something is “morally good” – in other words, if I propose an ethical theory – then clearly I am arguing that human beings *should* act in a particular manner, or *avoid* acting in a particular manner.

If I tell my son that he *should* become a baseball player just because I want him to, I am not stating a universal moral premise, but rather a personal preference. He is not *moral* if he becomes a baseball player, and neither is he *immoral* if he does not.

However, if I tell him that it is *moral* for sons to obey their fathers, and *immoral* for them to disobey their fathers, then I am proposing a preference that is universal, rather than merely personal – I am trying to turn a “little truth” (*I want you to become a baseball player*) into a “great truth” (*It is immoral for sons to disobey fathers*). *If* he wishes to be moral, he *must* become a baseball player – not because becoming a baseball player is moral, but rather because obeying his father is moral.

When I speak of a universal preference, I am really defining what is *objectively required*, or *necessary*, assuming a particular goal. *If* I want to live, I do not have to like jazz, but I *must* eat. “Eating” remains a preference – I do not *have* to eat, in the same way that I have to obey gravity – but “eating” is a universal, objective, and *binding* requirement for staying alive, since it relies on biological facts that cannot be wished away.

Ethics as a discipline can be defined as any theory regarding preferable human behaviour that is universal, objective, consistent – and binding. Naturally, preferential behaviour can only be binding if the goal is desired. If I say that it is *preferable* for human beings to exercise and eat well, I am not saying that human beings *must not* sit on the couch and eat potato chips. What I am saying is that *if* you want to be healthy, you *should* exercise and eat well.

As Hume famously pointed out, it is impossible to derive an “ought” from an “is.” What he meant by that was that *preference* in no way can be axiomatically derived from *existence*. It is true that a man who never exercises and eats poorly will be unhealthy. Does that mean that he “ought” to exercise and eat well? No. The “ought” is conditional upon the *preference*. If he wants to be healthy, he *ought* to exercise and eat well. It is true that if a man does not eat, he will die – we cannot logically derive from that fact a binding principle that he *ought* to eat. *If* he wants to live, then he *must* eat. However, his choice to live or not remains his own.

Similarly, there is no such thing as a universally “better” direction – it all depends upon the preferred destination. If I want to drive to New York from San Francisco, I “ought” to drive east. If I want to drive into the ocean from San Francisco, I “ought” to drive west. Neither “east” nor “west” can be considered universally “better.”

It is true that very few people *do* drive into the ocean, but that does not mean that it is universally true that nobody *ought* to drive into the ocean. Principles are not democratic – or, if they are, we once more face the problem of rank subjectivism, and must throw the entire concept of ethics out the window.

“Behaviour” exists in objective reality, outside our minds – the concepts “ought,” “should,” and “preference,” do not exist outside our minds. However, the fact that “ought” does not exist within objective reality does not mean that “ought” is completely subjective. Neither the scientific method nor numbers themselves exist within reality either, yet science and mathematics remain objective disciplines.

### Self-Defeating Arguments

In order to begin our discussion of ethics, it is essential that we understand the nature of *self-defeating arguments*.

In economics, a theory cannot be valid if it requires that prices go up and down at the same time. In physics, a theory cannot be valid if it requires that gases expand and contract simultaneously. In mathematics, a theory cannot be valid if it requires that two plus two equals five, since “five” is just another way of describing two plus three, not two plus two, and so to say that two plus two equals five is to say that five equals four, which is self-contradictory.

In general, any theory that contradicts itself in the utterance cannot be valid. It does not require external disproof, since it disproves itself. We do not need to examine every nook and cranny in the universe to determine that a “square circle” does not exist. The very concept is self-contradictory, and thus disproves itself in the utterance.

If I submit a complex mathematical proof to you, and you notice that, at the very beginning, I state that my proof relies on the fact that two plus two make both four and five at the same time, you do not need to read any further to know that my proof is invalid.

Similarly, as mentioned before, if I come up to you and say: “I do not exist,” my thesis automatically self-destructs. If I can communicate to you that I do not exist, then clearly I exist.

If I come up to you and say: “There is no such thing as truth,” then I am making a statement that I consider to be true claiming that truth does not exist. Again, my argument self-destructs.

If I tell you that “Language is meaningless,” then I have also contradicted myself. In order for me to verbally communicate that language is meaningless, language must have at least some meaning.

If I tell you that “Your senses are invalid,” then my argument also self-destructs, since I am using your sense of hearing to communicate to you that your sense of hearing is invalid. If I can successfully communicate my thesis to you, then your sense of hearing must be valid. Thus I must assume that your senses are valid in order to convince you that your senses are not valid, which cannot stand.
