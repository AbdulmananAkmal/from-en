### Pamahalaan at Relehiyon

Ang ideya na naipanganak ay lumilikha ng isang kontrata sa isang kathang-isip na ahensya, na sa praktikal na pananalita ay gagawin kang quasi- alipin sa isang partikular na tao, ay karaniwan sa parehas na relihiyon at ang estado - sa isa pa, sa mas personal na ahensya, na kung saan ako ay nagsasalita tungkol sa aking unang libro "Sa katotohanan: Ang Bagsik ng Ilusyon."

Tuwing sinasabi ng pari na: "Sundin ang Diyos," ang kayang talagang sinasabi ay: Sumunod *sakin*." Dahil sa ang Diyos ay hindi naman umiiral, ang anumang kautusan na sinasabi ng pari ay nanggagaling sa Diyos, ay ang totoo ay nanggagaling sa pari. "Diyos" ay isa lamang kathang-isp na nilalang na ginagamit upang lituhin ang iyong kaisipan upang makuha ang iyong pinaka praktikal na sunod- sunuran sa totoong mundo, sa mga totoong tao, sa mga tuntunin ng boluntaryong pagpapasa ng pera, panahon at mga yaman.

Ito ay mas mahusay para sa mga mapagsamantala na magkaroon ng kanilang mga alipinna isininasalang- alang ang mga alipin ng kabanalan, dahil ito ay nagpuputol ng sobrang pababa sa mga gastos ng pagkontrol sa kanila. Kung kaya ko lamang kumbinsihin ka na ito ay masama upang maiwasan ang mga naglilingkod sa akin, at marangal na maging aking alipin, pagkatapos ay hindi ko na kailangan kumuha ng maraming siga na mang-inis, magkontrol at magnakaw mula sa iyo.

Relihiyon at Pang- Estadong metolohiya, pagkatapos, ay mga kathang- isip na sobrang pinabababa ang gastos ng pagkontrol sa populasyon; Sila ay ang pampadulas at gasolina para sa malupit na makinarya ng isang institusyon ng karahasan.

Sa buong mundo, ang mga pinuno ay napakaliit na porsyento ng populasyon. Paano ito magiging posible para sa isa hanggang dalawang porsyento ng tao na kontrolin ang ibang? Mayroong isang partikular na monopolyo sa armamento, upang maging segurado, pero ang monopolyo ay relatibong mdali upang malabanan, dahil karamihan sa mga pamahalaan ay gumagawa ng kapalaran sa pagbebenta ng mga armas sa buong mundo.

Ang malungkot na katotohanan ay ang mga tao bilang isang buo ay maaaring alipinin sa kathang-isip na nilalang tulad ng bansa, Mga Diyos, Kultura - at pamahalaan.

Ang ating sariling kapalaluan ay agad na maghihimagsik laban sa madalian at sapilitang pang-aalipin sa isa pang nilalang - Gayunpaman, kami ay muntikan ng inalabas ang pag-aalipin sa *mitolohiya*.

Ang ating kagustuhan na maging mabuti - pinagsama kasama ang pangingilig sa kabanalan na makukuha sa pagsunod sa mitolohiyang moral - ay ating aporo patungo sa kusang loob na ibigay ang ating mga yaman sa mga nagsasabi upang kumatawan sa mga mitolohiya.

One central reason that we know that governments and gods are unnecessary is that they are so effective. *We know that most people desperately want to be good because they are so easily controlled by moral theories*.

The logic of obedience to mythology is patently foolish. If a priest tells me that I have to obey “God,” this is exactly the same as him telling me that I must obey an entity called “Nog.” Even if I accept that this fictional entity is worthy of eternal obedience, this still in no way would compel me to obey *the priest*. If I tell you to “obey your heart,” can I then reasonably say: “and *I alone* speak for your heart”?

Syempre hindi.

When we strip away mythology and fiction from our “interactions” with our rulers, what emerges is a grim, stark and murderously exploitive reality.

Gawin nating isang halimbawa ng isang tunay at kasalukuyang panganib: pagbubuwis.

#### Pagbubuwis

I am told that, by virtue of choosing to live in Canada, I owe “the government” more than fifty percent of my income.

Stripped of mythology, what does this really translate to?

Sa katunayan, maghihintay ako hanggang sa matapos ang "pamahalaan" na dumating at kunin ang pera nito. Waiting for “the government” to drop by is like wanting to date the concept “femininity.” I may as well try to pay for my dinner with the word “money.”

In reality, when I am told that I must pay my taxes to “the government,” what this actually means is that I must write a check to transfer my money into a particular bank account, which is then accessed by particular individuals. These individuals then have the right to take that money, and spend it as they see fit – these particular individuals thus have complete control over my money.

At no point whatsoever does any such entity as “the government” lift a finger, make a move, open a bank account, or spend a penny. Imagining that a concept called “the government” has the capacity to take or spend your money is exactly the same as waiting for “God” to come and pick you up and take you to church.

Thus the real interaction is that one guy sends me a letter telling me that I owe him money. I have no contract with this guy, and he does not in fact own any of my property, although some other guys wrote a supposed “contract” which claims that he does.

If I do not pay this guy, he will send another guy over to my house to collect the money – plus “interest” and “charges.”

Normally, when a man with a gun comes to my house and demands my money, I have the right to use force to defend myself. In this case, however, because he is in a costume and claims to represent a fictional entity, I am not allowed to use force to defend myself.

Now, if I come to your house tonight dressed as a “high elf of Narnia” and demand the money that you owe to the “Queen of Sorrows,” assuming it is not Halloween, you are allowed to stare at me in amazement, and order me off your property.

If I do not pay the man who comes to take my money, he is allowed to pull out a gun, point it at my chest, and kidnap me – or shoot me if I resist. He can hold me in a tiny cell for year after year, where I will be subjected to the most violent brutality and continual rape, until he chooses to let me go.

Interestingly, if a man legitimately owes me money, I am not allowed to kidnap him and subject him to torture and rape for year after year. Thus taxation utterly violates the UPB framework, since it is the violent transfer of property using the initiation of force.

Stealing, as we have proven, is evil.

Einstein revolutionised physics by claiming – and proving – that the speed of light was constant.

We can revolutionise the world by accepting the claim – and the proof – that stealing is always evil.

### Government, Religion, And UPB

When we take the UPB framework and apply it to moral propositions regarding government and religion, some very interesting results occur.

The proposition that is most often used to justify government power is: “the government has the right to take your money.” This, however, is an utterly imprecise and false statement. The “government” does not have the right to take your money, since “the government” is merely a concept, an abstract description for a self-defined group of people. UPB requires a more consistent and objective statement. Since moral rules must be the same for everyone in all places and at all times, we must rephrase the rule in this way:

“*Human beings can morally take money from other human beings if they make up a conceptual agency that justifies their actions.*”

If we return to Bob and Doug in our little room of moral experimentation, we can very quickly see that this becomes an impossible proposition.

If Bob says to Doug: “I now represent the ideal concept ‘FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me taking your lighter from you. Since you now owe me your lighter, you must hand it over, or I will be compelled to take it from you by force.”

What will Doug’s reaction be? Remember, according to UPB, whatever is valid for Bob must also be valid for Doug. Inevitably, Doug will reply: “Oh yeah? Well *I* now represent the ideal concept ‘ANTI-FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me retaining possession of my lighter. Since you now have no right to take my lighter, if you try to take it, I will be compelled to defend myself by force.”

As you can see, if *Bob* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Doug, then *Doug* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Bob. Clearly, we immediately end up in a perfect stalemate. If it is morally good to impose made-up obligations on other people, but it is impossible to do it if *everyone* possesses that ability, then morality becomes impossible. The only way that Bob can impose his made-up obligation on Doug is if Doug refuses to impose his made up obligation on Bob – thus we have a situation where what is moral for one person can only be achieved by the other person acting in an anti-moral manner. Virtue can thus only be enabled by vice, which is impossible – and we have opposing moral rules for two human beings in the same circumstance, which UPB instantly rejects as invalid.

In other words, every imaginary abstract justification for the use of force can be countered by another imaginary abstract justification for the use of force. If I have an imaginary friend that can justify everything I do, then *you* also can have an imaginary friend that can justify everything you do. Thus neither of us can possess the ability to impose our imaginary obligations on others.

#### Religion And UPB

The same holds true for religion.

The statement: “You must obey me because God commands it,” must be restated more accurately as: “an entity that I have made up commands you to obey me.” The principle that UPB requires, then, is: “Human beings must impose unchosen positive obligations on others, and justify those obligations according to imaginary entities.”

Here we see the same issues as above. Bob tells Doug: “You must give me your lighter, because my imaginary friend tells you to.” Naturally, Doug replies: “You must not ask me for your lighter, because *my* imaginary friend forbids you to.” If Bob’s “commandments” are valid, then Doug’s “commandments” are equally valid, and so cancel each other out.

In the same way, if a man claims that his concept called “the government” justifies his theft of my property, then I can claim that my concept called “the anti-government” justifies my *retention* of my property, and we are both equally “valid” in our justifications.

If this tax collector then claims that his concept called “the government” only justifies his theft of *my* property, not my retention of it, then we are no further ahead. He can take my thousand dollars, but then I can invoke my concept to “steal” that money back, and his moral theory commands us to spend the rest of eternity handing back and forth the thousand dollars.

#### UPB And "The Majority"

UPB does not allow for the accumulation of individuals to override or reverse the properties of each individual. Ten lions do not make an elephant, a government, or a god. Ten thousand soldiers might make an “army,” but they cannot reverse gravity, or make murder moral.

Returning one last time to the room of Bob and Doug, let’s introduce “Jane.”

Now that there are three people in the room, we can look at the “majority rule” principle.

If Bob, Doug and Jane take a “vote” on whether or not it is moral to rape Jane, we would all recoil at such an unjust and immoral premise. Clearly, even if Jane were “outvoted,” we would not consider the resulting rape to be transformed into a morally good act.

Why not?

Well, UPB does not recognise the reality of aggregations, since the “majority” is a mere conceptual tag; it does not exist in reality, any more than “gods” or “governments” do. Thus to claim that the concept of “the majority” has any sort of moral standing is utterly invalid – it is like saying that “the Fatherland” can impregnate a woman, or that one can sit in the word “chair.”

To say that “the majority” has rights or attributes which directly contradict the rights or attributes of any individual also contradicts rational principles, since any conceptual grouping is only validated by the accurate identification of individual characteristics. If I say that “mammals” are warm-blooded living creatures, can I logically include three plastic flamingos in the category “mammal”?

Of course not.

Thus if it is evil for human beings to rape, can I logically create a category called “the majority” and then claim that for *these* human beings, rape is now morally good?

Of *course* not.

### Majority Rule

Can I create a moral rule that says: “the majority should be able to do whatever it wants”?

Of course I can, but it will never be valid or true.

Only *individuals* act – the “majority” never does. If moral rules can change when a certain number of people get together, then UPB is continually violated.

If it is moral for Bob and Doug to rape Jane because they have “outvoted her,” what happens when Jane’s two friends show up and vote against Bob and Doug’s infernal desires?

Well, suddenly Bob and Doug are the ones outvoted, and rape becomes “evil” for them again.

Nothing substantial has changed in these “outvoting” scenarios, but we have a series of opposing moral rules for the same men – a violation of UPB, and thus invalid.

Rape cannot be good, then evil, then good again, just because a few hands are raised or lowered.

Thus if you think that “majority rule” sounds like a reasonable moral proposition, and a perfectly valid moral theory, then I am afraid you’re going to have to go back to the beginning of this book and start again!☺
