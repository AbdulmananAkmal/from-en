## Pag papairal Laban sa Hindi Pagpapairal

Tinutukoy namin na ang "di-pagkakaroon" bilang hindi nagtatagalay ng masa o lakas, o pagpapakita ng mga epekto ng masa o lakas, tulad ng nakikita sa mga relasyon na gaya ng garbidad.

Ang Diyos ay Hindi nag tataglay ng mass o lakas, o nagpapakita ng mga epekto ng masa o lakas - sa katunayan ang Diyos ay Hindi makikita o mapapatunayan sa anuman paraan, ng hugis o porma, kahit na sa mga pandama, o sa pamamagitan ng pagkamaykatwiran.

Kaya Kung sinasabi ko, " Diyos ay buhay," Ang talagang sinasabi ko ay:

"*Ang buhay ay dapat nakikita; Ang Diyos ay hindi nakikita, pero ang Diyos ay nabuhay - samakatuwid ito ay Hindi nabuhay, mga buhay.*"

Sa ibang salita, sa pagsasabi "Ang Diyos ay buhay," ako ay nakagawa ng hindi malutas na pagkakasalungatan. Aking tutukuyin "ang pagkakaruon" sa "hindi-pagkakaruon," na gumagawa tungkol sa masa maraming kahuligan bilang pagtukoy sa "buhay" at"walang buhay na bagay," o sa bato bilang "Ang kabaligtaran ng bato," o sa "kuwadrado" bilang isang "bilog."

Ang pagkakatulad, kung ako ay gagawa ng ilang alternatibong universo na kung saan ang "walang buhay katumbas ng buhay at "mag kasalungat katumbas ng Hindi nag babago" at Ang "katotohanan katumbas ng kasinungalingan"at Ang "pagkamakatwiran katumbas ng Hindi makatwiran," kung anu talaga ang ginawa ko nakalikha ako ng Lupain na tinataw na "pagkakamali," ipalagay na ang lahat ng ito ay Hindi totoo, at ang tinutukoy ng lupain na ito ay isang lugar na Kung saan ang "pagkakamali ay katumbas ng katotohanan."[^2]

Syempre, ang tao ay bawal gumawa nito "alternatibong universo" upang mapawalang bisa ang katotohanan sa loob ng ating universo, pero sahalip na alisin ang mali sa katotohanan, at tawaging itong totoo. Halimbawa, walang sinuman nag-uudyok "ang Diyos ay nabuhay sa ibang universo, kaya hindi mo pweding sabihin na ang Diyos ay hindi nabuhay" kaylanman ipaliwanag "*I* maaaring hindi nabuhay sa ibang universo, kaya hindi mo pweding ariin na ako ay nabuhay dito."

Sila rin ay may pusibilidad na hindi tumugon ng mabuti sa argumentong ito: " sa iba pang universo, ikaw ay pweding sumang ayon saakin na hindi nagkaruon ng Diyos, kaya ginawa mo ang isang ateista."[^3]

Kung wasto ang pahayag tungkol sa katotohanan maaaring walang katapusan ang sasalungat dahil ang ilan ay nasaisipang lupain na tinatawag na "ang pagkakamali ay katumbas ng katotohanan" mawawalan bisa ito, kung ang sinasabi ay "walang magandang pahayag tunkol sa katotohanan na maaaring mag patunay" _ gayun paman, ang amin talino ay sapat bilang pilosopo sa ngayon upang malaman na ang mismong pahayag ay nagkakasalungat sa sarili, dahil ito ay isang mabuting pahayag na maituturing para maging totoo na nagsasabing walang mabuting pahayag na magiging totoo. Kung walang magiging tama o mali- kahit na sa pahayag - walang anuman pahayag ang magagawa tungkol sa anuman bagay. Gamit ang salita, gamit ang english, gamit ang mga nauunawaan pangungusap _ang lahat ay giwang walang kabuluhan kahit anu paman, dahil sa ito ay "alternatibong universo" tulad ng nakabalagkas na pananalita ito ay maituturing na talagang walang kabuluhan. Kung ang mga bagay na pweding maging totoo sa alternatibong uniberso ay magkakaruon ng epecto sa pahayag at gagawin natin itong uniberso, at sigurado ang kabaliktaran ay totoo din, ibig-sabihin ang mga walang pahayag ay Hindi makakagawa ng kahit anu, dahil ang kanilang eksaktong kabaliktaran ay maaring maging totoo.

Ang totoong reyalidad sa pahayag ang "pagkakamali ay katumbas ng katotohanan" at ang tautological ay kabaliwan ng " null katumbas ng null."

### Ang "Alternatibong uniberso" sa lipunan ng mga tao

Ang dahilan Kung bakit kami ay gumugugol ng labis na oras sa pagharap sa "Alternatibong uniberso" Ang teorya ay may derectang kaugnayan sa lipunan ng tao at ginagamit ito para "mabigyang-katwiran" ang mga dakilang kasamaan na ginamit sa atin.

At sa aking sariling karanasan, nalaman ko na ang pumatay ay Mali. Ang gumawaga sa pamamagitan ng panukala na ang pagpatay ay normal na mali ang pinaka magandang halimbawa ay, Lubos akong nag aalinlangan kahit kanino at nagulat ng magkaruon ng normal na instink kunpirma sa pamamagitan ng mahigpit na abstract sa kadahilanan ng UPB. Ang seksiyon na ito, gayunman, ito ay oposiyal na pinayagan para sa iyo para masimulan ang maging tunay na shocked.

Ang pinakadakilang leaps forward sa sayantipikong pang-unawa ay tinatawag na "tearya ng pagkakaisa." Einstein dekada na Ang ginugol at sinisikap maayos ang isang pinag-isang teorya Ng patlang; at mga teorya ng physic na nagiisa sa malakas at mahinang pwersa, Ang electromagnetism, gravity at Kung anu ano pa ay mananatiling mailap.

UPB bilang isang balangkas, gayunman, hindi lamang napapatunayan ang moral instincts sa pangsariling, philosopiya at sa mga antas ng unibersal_ ngunit may malalim at nakakagulat na impikasyon para sa lipunan ng tao.

#### Aksyon ng UPB

Ang balagkas ng UPB ay nag papatunay sa mga panukalang moral sa pamamagitan ng paghingi na sila ay pare-pareho, at ang unibersal sa tuntunin ng oras, lugar at bawat tao.

Kung tatangapin namin ang UPB, dapat din namin tangapin ang mga sumusunod na pagsasama:

- Ang moral na panukala ay independiyente ng kasuotan.

Ang ibigsabihin nito ay ang isang tao hindi pweding baguhin ang kanyang moral kalikasan kasama ang kanyang kasuotan. Ang paggawa ng pagbabago sa kasuotan ay hindi Makakapagpabago sa pangunahin katangian. Kung kaya't ang pagsalungat sa moral na alituntunin ay Hindi wasto batay sa mga may suot ng mga damit.

Sundalo, syempre, silay nagsusuot ng naiiba sa karaniwang mamayan. The average citizen is forbidden to murder; soldiers, however, are not only *allowed* to murder, but are morally *praised* for murdering.

Dalhin ang ibapang halimbawa.

Ang pagnanakaw ay mali sa moral, tulad ng nakita natin sa itaas. Ito ay moral na mali sa lahat ng tao sa lahat ng pagkakataon sa lahat ng oras at sa ilalim ng lahat ng mga pangyayari. Dahil ang pagnanakaw ay sapilitan pag alis ng mga ari arian ng ibang tao ng walang pahintulot, Kung gayon ang laging pagbubuwis sa buong Mondo at magpakaylanman ay moral na masama. Ang pag bubuwis ay sapamamagitan ng kahulugan Ang sapilitan pag alis ng Ari arian sa ibang tao ng walang pahintulot, yamang ang pagbubuwis ay umaasa sa pagsisimula gumamit ng pwersa upang iwaksi ang isang tao sa kanyang ari arian.

At ang tawag dito ay "Ang gobyerno" ay isapang halimbawa lamang ng *null zone* Kung saan ang taas ay baba, Ang itim ay put, ang katotohanan ay kasinungalingan, at ang masama ay mabuti.

Ang pag unlad ng lipunan eksakto sa antas ng dahilan at katibayan gawin ang pinaka magandang harbang mula sa sarili hangang sa unibersal, at sirain ang anuman hind makatwiran*null zones* sa daan. Ang pag unlad ng agham eksakto sa antas kaya tinatangihan nito ang kawalang katwiran ng Diyos "absolutes." ang pag unlad ng Meisina ay eksato sa antas kaya tinatangihan nito ang bisa ng panalangin at walang saysay na ritwal umaasa sa dahilan at katibayan. Pilosopiya din - at ang lipunan ng tao sa pangkalahatan - ay umuunlad eksakto sa antas kaya tinatangihan nito ang kawalang katwiran ng " square-circle na moralidad" ng statist at relihiyon mga ethical na teorya.

### Pamahalaan

Sinasabing ang mga operasyon ng pamahalaan ay nasa ilalim ng tapat na mga patakaran ng moralidad mula sa iba pang lipunan ay eksakto ang parehong sinasabi, " leprechauns ay tinatablan ng grabidad." Una sa lahat leprechauns ay hindi umiiral-at isa sa mga paraan para malaman natin na ito ay hindi umiiral ay tinatangap nila na sila ay tinatablan ng grabidad. Ang lahat ng mya mass ay napapailalim ng grabidad - na kung saan ay immune sa grabidad sapamamagitan ng kahulugan ay walang mass, at samakatuwid ay hindi umiiral. Ang pahayag "leprechuans ay immune sa grabidad" ay isang tautolohiya, na nagpapatunay lamgang sa di-pagkakaruon ng leprechauns - ito ang simantiko katumbas ng "na hindi umiiral, hindi umiiral."A ay A, ang unang batas luhika ni Aristotle, ay mahalaga lamang upang kumpirmahin ang pagkakaroon na kung sang tinutukoy bilang hindi pagkakaroon.

In the same way, when we say that it is morally good for soldiers to murder and government representatives to steal, we know that “soldiers” and “government representatives” as moral categories are *completely invalid*.

If I say that a square circle has the right to steal, I am merely saying that that which cannot exist has the right to do that which is self-contradictory – a purely nonsensical statement, but one which remains strangely compelling in the “null zone” of politics.

If I buy a soldier’s costume at a second hand store, and put it on, clearly I have not created an alternative universe wherein opposite moral rules can be valid. The moment before I put the costume on, it was wrong for me to murder – when does it become *right* for me to murder? When I put on the trousers? What if I have the trousers on, but not the vest? What if I have only one boot on? What about if both boots are on, but only one is laced? What if my hat is on backwards? What if I have put on a uniform that is not recognised by the first person I come across? Did the Beatles suddenly possess the right to murder when they shot the cover for “Sergeant Peppers”? Did they lose that right when they took off their jackets?

I ask these rhetorical questions because they are in fact deadly serious. Clearly, a military costume does not change the nature of a human being, any more than a haircut turns him into a duck, a concept, or a god.

“Ah,” you may say, “but the costume is invalid because you got it at a second hand store – putting on the uniform of the soldier no more makes you a soldier than photocopying a doctorate gives you a Ph.D.”

The analogy is incorrect, because having a Ph.D. or photocopying a doctorate does not change any of the moral rules that you are subjected to as a human being.

“Well,” you may reply, “but the difference is that the soldier possesses moral rights that are provided to him by the average citizen, for the sake of collective self-defence and so on.”

This raises a very interesting point, which is the question of whether opinions can change reality.

### Opinions And Reality

Clearly, we understand that I cannot through my opinion release you from the restraints of gravity, any more than my opinion that “two plus two equals five” makes it true.

“Opinions” are those beliefs which have no clear evidence in reality, or for which no clear evidence can be provided, or which are expressions of merely personal preferences. My personal opinion is that I prefer chocolate ice cream to vanilla – I may also have an “opinion” that Iceland is a tropical paradise, or that God exists, or that rain falls upward. Personal opinions clearly have nothing to do with morality; opinions that claim to accurately describe reality, but which do not, are merely incorrect prejudices. Believing that the rain falls upward does not reverse its course; wearing a Hawaiian shirt to Iceland does not make Reykjavik any warmer.

Thus believing that murder is morally good does not make murder morally good. Since my beliefs about a human being do not change his moral nature, my belief that his murders are virtuous does not change the virtue of his actions. If I close my eyes and imagine that you are a lizard, you do not suddenly lose your ability to regulate your own body temperature. Imagining that you are a fish does not bypass your need for scuba gear.

Opinions do not change reality.

Because opinions do not change reality, I cannot grant you any exception or reversal with regards to a universal moral rule. Since moral rules are based on universal logic, as well as the physical nature and reality of a human being, I cannot grant you the “right to murder,” any more than I can grant you the ability to levitate, walk on water or accurately say that two and two make five.

### Government As Voluntarism

The open force involved in the institution of government – the conceptual wrapper that reverses moral rules for a particular group of individuals – is something that is always kept off the table in debates. When talking about government, it is never considered a positive thing to point out “the gun in the room.” Almost by definition, governments are considered to be chosen by and for the people, and to operate with their expressed or implicit approval.

However, this is pure nonsense.

If a man holds a knife to a woman’s throat while having sex with her, that is by any definition an act of rape. He cannot say that the sex is consensual, while at the same time threatening her with injury or death if she refuses to have sex with him. If the sex is voluntary, then the knife is completely unnecessary. If the man feels the need for a knife, then clearly the sex is *not* voluntary.

In the same way, people say that taxation is part of the social contract that they have voluntarily agreed to.

This is both logically and empirically false.

We know that it is empirically false because *no social contract exists*. Neither you nor I *ever* signed a document voluntarily consenting to the income tax – we were simply born into a system that takes our money from us at the point of a gun.

### The Gun In The Room

Many people will argue at this point that taxation is not enforced at the point of a gun, but rather that people pay it voluntarily. For instance, I have never had a gun pointed in my face by a tax collector or a policeman, but I have paid taxes for decades.

This may be true, but it is completely irrelevant. If I tell a woman that I will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, and she submits herself to me, we clearly understand that an immoral action has taken place – even though I have used no weapon in my violation. Clearly, if the woman submits to me, it is because she fears that I will carry out my threat. If I told her that my pet leprechaun will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, she would very likely be disturbed, but would not fear my threat in any significant way, since it is impossible for my pet leprechaun to kill her children. Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

[^2]: Let’s not even get *started* on the logical nightmare of the truth value contained in the statement “error equals truth.”

[^3]: This argument tends also not to work very well with maths teachers – I have never seen a student successfully argue that an incorrect answer may be correct in another universe, and so it is unjust to mark it as wrong.
