## UPB更具挑战性的测试

我们现在已经测试了与UPB框架相关的特定的道德理论，并发现UPB验证了我们最普遍持有的道德信念，例如禁止强奸，谋杀和盗窃。 通过将*可避免性*的标准纳入分析之中，我们还帮助区分了不可避免的犯罪和必须通过积极行为才能实施的犯罪，如欺诈行为。 最终，我们把“优选的行为”分为三个主要类别-普遍的，审美的，中立的(及其相关的对立面)。 普遍禁止的行为包括强奸，谋杀和盗窃，这些可以用武力来阻止。 审美学上可取的行为包括礼貌，准时等，不能通过暴力来强制执行。 中立行为包括纯粹的主观偏好，或者没有道德内容的行为，例如追赶巴士。

然而，在我们上面所处理的例子之外，仍然存在很多具有挑战性的道德测试。 我们在这里只会讨论一部分，来看看UPB的框架，以及它是如何处理这些更具挑战性的道德问题的。

### 自我防卫

自卫的概念不应被视为理所当然。 如果我们假设没有自卫这样的事情，或者说自卫永远不是一个有效的行为，那么UPB的框架很快就会解除这个假设。

如果不存在自卫这样的事情的话，那么我们并不是在讨论使用武力的引发与报复，而是在任何情况下使用武力。 换句话说，如果我们摆脱了自卫的概念，我们唯一需要问自己的问题是：*使用武力是否普遍可取？*

如果说武力普遍适用，那么任何人都不应提出道德论证，而应该使用武力来达到目的。 然而，就像上面所提到的例子如强奸，盗窃和谋杀一样，声称普遍优先使用武力的说法将会立即使之失效。 为了能够对他人使用武力而要求该人屈服于武力-换句话说，为了一个人有道德，另一个人必须是不道德的，这是不成立的。 同样，如果对方*屈服*于武力，这就不是武力-因此他必须*反抗*，这就要求他以抵抗美德来使用美德，这是自相矛盾的。

此外，如果总是优先使用武力，那么强奸和谋杀等罪行则变得无关紧要，因为如果总是优先使用武力，那么性爱将变得不道德，而强奸则变成了道德-但只是为了强奸犯，而让他*屈服*于武力，而不是武力本身，这对他的受害者来说是道德的，但这是矛盾的。

如果，另一方面，我们说暴力是坏的，那么我们就开放了自卫的可能性。如果这是一个UPB的标准声明说暴力是邪恶的，那么我们知道，由于使用暴力可以防止邪恶，所以使用武力来*反对*暴力在道德上是有效的。

因此，既然我们知道暴力是邪恶的，那么我们就可以用武力来反对它。 如果我们把行为定义为邪恶的，而且阻止任何人采取行动来反对它，那么我们将不再是道德哲学家，而只是评判考古学家。 这类似于一种医学理论，认为疾病是不好的，但是试图预防或治愈疾病是邪恶的-而这是没有任何意义的。

此外，如果人类不能有效地采取行动，以防止伤害自己，那么像接种，在寒冷中戴上手套，涂防晒霜或驱虫剂，盖墙以防止滑坡，刷牙，穿鞋等这些行为都是不道德的行为。 如果我们回到鲍勃和道格，我们给他们一个道德的论点，即自卫总是错误的，结果会是什么呢？

那么，我们又创造了另一个悖论。 自卫就是使用暴力来防止暴力。 如果自卫总是错误的，那么就不能对攻击者“施加”暴力。 然而，不能被他人强加的偏好属于APA或道德中性范畴。 把自卫暴力置于这些类别是说暴力不能强加在他人身上-但是暴力的本质就*是*强加于他人，因此这种方法的结果是导致了过多的矛盾。

自卫不能是“邪恶的”，因为定义上的邪恶可以通过武力来阻止。 然而，自卫是对发动武力的回应，因此不能通过武力来阻止，正如你能通过猛踢一个足球来阻止它的运动。

Self-defence also cannot be *required* behaviour, since required behaviour (“don’t rape”) can be enforced through violence, which would mean that anyone failing to violently defend himself could be legitimately aggressed against. However, someone failing to defend himself is *already* being aggressed against, and so we end up in a circular situation where everyone can legitimately act violently against a person who is not defending himself, which is not only illogical, but morally abhorrent.

If Bob attacks Doug, but it is completely wrong for Doug to use violence to defend himself, then violence ends up being placed into two moral categories – the initiation of force is morally good, but self-defence is morally evil, which cannot stand according to UPB.

However, you might argue, does not the proposition that self-defence is good also make violence both good and bad at the same time – the violence that is used to attack is bad, but the violence that is used for self-defence is good?

This is an interesting objection – however, if the initiation of force is evil, then it can be prohibited by using force, since that is one of the very definitions of evil that we worked out above.

Thus it is impossible for any logical moral theory to reject the moral validity of self-defence.

### Child Raising

Instinctively, we generally understand that there is something quite wrong with parents who do not feed their babies. To conceive a child, carry a child to term, give birth to the child, and then leave it lying in its crib to starve to death, severely offends our sensibilities.

Of course, our offence is in no way a moral argument, but it is an excellent starting place to test a moral theory.

Before, when we were talking about UPB, we noted that, where there are exceptions in UPB, there must be objective differences in biology. Or, to put it more accurately, where there are objective differences in biology, there may be rational exceptions or differences in UPB. A child of five has a biologically immature brain and nervous system, and thus cannot rationally process the long-term consequences of his actions. It is the immature brain that is the key here, insofar as if an adult male is retarded to the point where his brain is the equivalent to that of a five year old, he would also have a reduced responsibility for his actions.

Thus when we point to situations of reduced responsibility, we are not *taking away* responsibility that exists, but rather recognising a situation where responsibility does not exist, at least to some degree. If I say that a man in a wheelchair cannot take the escalator, I am not taking away his right to take the escalator, but merely pointing out that he cannot, in fact, use it. When I say that UPB does not apply to the actions of a five year old, I am not saying that UPB is subjective, any more than a height requirement for a roller coaster somehow makes the concept of “tall” subjective.

If I voluntarily enter into a contract with you wherein I promise to pay your bills for a year, I have not signed myself into slavery, but I certainly have taken on a positive obligation that I am now responsible for.

If I run a nursing home, and I take in patients who are unable to feed themselves, then if I do not feed those patients, I am responsible for their resulting deaths. No one is *forcing* me to take in these patients, but once I have expressed a desire and a willingness to take care of them, then I am responsible for their continued well-being.

In the same way, if I borrow your lawnmower, I am obligated to bring it back in more or less the same state that it was when I borrowed it. Similarly, if I go to a pet store and buy a dog, I have taken on a voluntary obligation to take care of that dog. This does not mean that I am now the dog’s slave until the day it dies, but it does mean that as long as the dog is in my possession, I have a responsibility to try to keep it healthy.

These kinds of implicit contracts are quite common in life. We do not sign a contract with a restaurateur when we go to eat a meal in his restaurant; it is simply understood that we will pay before we leave. I have never signed a contract when I walk into a store promising not to shoplift, but they have the right to prosecute me if I do. I also have never signed a contract promising not to rape a woman if we go on a date, yet such a “contract” certainly exists, according to UPB.

If I run a nursing home, and disabled people rely on me to feed them, if I prove unable to feed them for some reason, then my responsibility is clearly to find somebody else who will feed them. The grave danger is not that *I* don’t feed them, but rather that everyone else thinks that I *am* feeding them, and so do not provide them food. This accords with an old moral argument about diving into a river to save someone from drowning. I am not obligated to dive into a river to save someone from drowning, but the moment that I do – or state my intention openly – then I am responsible for trying to save that person, for the very practical reason that everyone else thinks that I am going to save that person, and so may not take direct action themselves.

Thus it is assumed that parents will feed and take care of their newborn baby. If said parents decide against such care-giving, then they are obligated to give the child up to other people who *will* care for it, or face the charge of murder, just as the manager of a home for the disabled must either feed those who utterly depend on him, or give them up to someone who will. If I decide that I no longer want to take care of my dog, I must find him another home, not simply let him starve to death.

This all relies on the principle of third-party self-defence, which is fully supported by the framework of UPB, since the right of self-defence is universal. If I see a man in a wheelchair being attacked by a woman, I have the right to defend him – and this is all the more true if he lacks the capacity to defend himself.

Since children cannot feed themselves, earn a living or live independently, they are the moral equivalent of kidnap victims, or the wife we talked about before whose husband locked her in the basement. Children also lack the capacity for effective self-defence, due to their small stature and near-complete dependence upon their parents.

Thus since it is certainly the case that we have the right to act in self-defence for someone else – and that right becomes even stronger if that person cannot act in his own self-defence, it is perfectly valid to use force against parents who do not feed their children, just as it is perfectly valid to use force against the husband who is starving his wife to death by locking her in the basement.

As we also mentioned above, the less able a victim is to avoid the situation, the worse the crime is. Even the wife who ends up locked in the basement has at least *some* ownership in the matter, because she chose to marry this evil lunatic to begin with. Once she is locked in the basement, the situation is unavoidable, yet there were doubtless many clues hinting at her husband’s abusive nature, from the day she first met him.

Children, however, are the ultimate victims, because they never had any chance to avoid the situations they find themselves in. Thus we can logically establish the responsibility of parents towards their children by using the UPB framework. Since every person is responsible for the effects of his or her body, and children are an effect of the body, then parents are responsible for their children. Since everyone has the right to self-defence, for themselves and for others – since it is a universal right – then anyone can act to defend children. Since everyone must fulfil voluntary obligations, and having children is a voluntary obligation, parents must fulfil those obligations related to children. Since, through inaction, causing the death of someone completely dependent upon you is the equivalent of murder, parents are liable for such a crime.

We could of course put forward the proposition that parents do not have to take care of their children, but that is far too specific a principle to be a moral premise – it would be the same as saying “parents can murder,” which is not UPB-compliant, and so would require a biological differentiation to support an exception – and becoming a parent does not utterly overturn and reverse one’s biological nature.

Parents who starve a child to death are clearly guilty of murder. Children are born into this world in a state of involuntary imprisonment within the family – this does not mean that the family is evil, or corrupt – it is simply a statement of biological fact. Children are by the parents’ choice enslaved to the parents – this form of biological incarceration puts negligent parents in the same moral position as a kidnapper who allows his captive to starve to death, or a nurse who lets her utterly-dependent patients die of thirst.
