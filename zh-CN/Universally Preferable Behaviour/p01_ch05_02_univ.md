### UPB：五个证明

正如我们前面所讨论的，不存在这样的东西作为优选行为的命题包含了难以克服的逻辑和经验问题。“普遍优先的行为”必须是一个有效的概念，主要有五个原因。

第一个是合乎逻辑的：如果我反对普遍优越的行为是有效的这一命题，那么我已经表明了我对真理胜过谬误的偏爱 -以及对纠正那些虚伪的人的偏爱。说没有这样的东西作为普遍较好的行为就像是在人的耳朵听起来不存在–这天生的自我矛盾的。换言之，如果没有普遍优越的行为，那么就应该反对任何声称普遍优越的行为这样的事情的人。然而，如果一个人“应该”做某件事，那么他就会创造出普遍的好行为。因此，普遍可取的行为或道德规则必须是有效的。

语言学上，这是：

1.  命题是：“普遍可取的行为”的概念必须是有效的。
2.  反对普遍优越行为的有效性表明普遍可取的行为。
3.  因此，任何反对普遍可取的行为有效性的论点都是无效的。

我们都知道有主观的喜好，如喜欢冰淇淋或爵士乐，这些都不被视为对其他人有约束力。另一方面，还有其他的偏好，如强奸和谋杀，这些偏好明显是对他人造成的。还有一些逻辑、真理和证据也有偏好，它们对其他人也是有约束力的（尽管它们通常不是暴力造成的），因为我们都接受一个不合逻辑的命题必须是虚假的或无效的。

那些可以被认为具有约束力的偏好可以称为“普遍偏好 ”或 “道德规则”。

否则我们怎么能知道 “道德规则” 的概念是有效的？

我们可以从生物学角度和疑问句中考察这个问题。

例如，所有物质都受制于物理规则 - 所有生活中的事物都是受某些要求的限制，因此，如果它是活的，那么它必须遵循普遍的偏好行为。例如，生命需要燃料和氧气。当然，任何活生生的思想都是物质世界的一个有机组成部分，因此受制于物理法则，必须遵循普遍的偏好行为 - 否则，就需要证明意识不是由物质构成的，也不是有机的 - 这是不可能的，因为它具有质量、能量和生命。认为意识既不受物理规则，也不受普遍偏爱的行为的影响，就好像是说人类不受地心重力的影响，而且可以在不吃东西的情况下蓬勃发展。

因此，任何人都不可能在逻辑上反对普遍优越的行为，因为如果他活着是为了争辩，那么他一定会遵循普遍偏好的行为，如呼吸，饮食。

语言学上，这是：

1.  所有生物都需要普遍偏好的行为来生活。
2.  人是活的有机体。
3 .  因此，所有活着的人都是活着的，因为实践普遍偏好的行为。
4    因此，任何反对普遍可取行为的论点都要求接受和实践普遍偏好的行为。
5    因此，不存在反对普偏好的行为的论点是可能有效的。

由于科学方法需要经验证实，我们也必须着眼于现实来证实我们的假设 -并且在这里完全支持普遍优先行为的有效性。

每一个理智的人都相信某种道德准则。关于什么是道德规则存在一些分歧，但是每个人都确信道德规则是有效的 - 就像许多科学家不同意的那样，但是所有的科学家都接受科学方法本身的有效性。人们可以争辩说，地球是圆的，而不是平坦的，这与改变道德的定义类似 - 但人们不能说地球根本不存在 - 这就好像在争辩，没有普遍的可取行为。

或：

1. 科学理论的有效性必须得到经验的支持。
2.  如果“普遍优越行为”的概念是有效的，那么人类就应该相信普遍可取的行为。
3.  人人都相信普遍可取的行为。
4.  因此，经验证据支持普遍优越的行为的有效性，而这种证据的存在则反对普遍优先的行为无效的主张。

第四的寺庙为普遍地优选的行为的有效性的论据也是经验主义的。由于人类在生活中有几乎无限的选择，所以说没有普遍适用的行为原则就是说所有的选择都是平等的（即主观的）。然而, 所有的选择都是不平等的, 无论是逻辑上或通过经验观察. 

例如，如果有食物，几乎所有的人都喜欢每天吃。寒冷的时候, 几乎所有的人都在寻求温暖。几乎所有的父母都选择喂养，庇护和教育他们的孩子。在人类中有许多共同选择的例子，这表明普遍喜欢的行为盛行并且是人性的一部分。

如上所述，没有任何有效的物理理论可以否定一个简单的事实, 即儿童可以捕捉飞球 - 同样，没有一个有效的道德理论能够拒绝接受UPB的无尽证据。

或：

1.  选择几乎是无限的。
2. 大多数人的选择非常相似。
3.   因此, 并不是所有的选择都是平等的。
4.  因此，普遍可取的选择必须是有效的。

第五个论证普遍有效行为的有效性是进化的。

由于所有的有机生命都需要有利于生存的行为，所以我们可以假设那些做出最成功选择的有机体是最经常被选择来生存的生物。

既然人类是最成功的物种，人类最独特的器官就是他的思想，那么人类的头脑一定会帮助他做出成功的选择。于是，心灵本身就被选择成功，因为它有能力做出成功的选择。既然人类的思维只存在于选择普遍的最佳行为，那么普遍可取的行为必须是一个有效的概念。

Or:

1. Organisms succeed by acting upon universally preferable behaviour.
2. Man is the most successful organism.
3. Therefore man must have acted most successfully on the basis of universally preferable behaviour.
4. Man’s mind is his most distinctive organ.
5. Therefore man’s mind must have acted most successfully on the basis of universally preferable behaviour.
6. Therefore universally preferable behaviour must be valid.

We could bring many more arguments to support the existence and validity of UPB, but we shall rest our case with the above, and move to an examination of the nature of UPB.

#### UPB: Optional And Objective

Since we have proven the validity of universally preferable behaviour, the question of morality now shifts. Since morality *is* valid, what theories can quantify, classify, explain and predict it?

First of all, we must remember that morality is clearly optional. Every man is subject to gravity and requires food to live, but no man has to act morally. If I rape, steal or kill, no thunderbolt strikes me down. Moral rules, like the scientific method or biological classifications, are merely ways of rationally organising facts and principles relative to objective reality.

The fact that compliance with moral rules is *optional*, however, has confused many thinkers into believing that morality itself is *subjective*. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Living organisms are part of material reality, and material reality is rational and objective. Applying moral theories is optional, but that does not mean that all moral theories are subjective. The scientific method is also optional, but it is not subjective. Applying biological classifications is optional, but biology is not subjective. Choices are optional; consequences are not. I can choose not to eat, but I cannot choose to live without eating. I can choose to behead someone, but I cannot choose whether or not they can live without a head. Morality is thus optional, but the *effects* of moral choices are measurable and objective.

Now, since morality is a valid concept, the next question is: to what degree or extent is morality valid?

As mentioned above, the first test of any scientific theory is *universality*. Just as a theory of physics must apply to *all* matter, a moral theory that claims to describe the preferable actions of mankind *must apply to **all** mankind*. No moral theory can be valid if it argues that a certain action is *right* in Syria, but *wrong* in San Francisco. It cannot say that Person A *must* do X, but Person B must *never* do X. It cannot say that what was *wrong* yesterday is *right* today – or vice versa. If it does, it is false and must be refined or discarded.

To be valid, any moral theory must also pass the criterion of *logical consistency*. Since the behaviour of matter is logical, consistent and predictable, all theories involving matter – either organic or inorganic – must also be logical, consistent and predictable. The theory of relativity cannot argue that the speed of light is both constant and not constant at the same time, or that it is one hundred eighty-six thousand kilometres per second, five kilometres in depth, and also green in colour.

However, since moral theories apply to mankind, and mankind is organic, the degree of *empirical* consistency required for moral theories is less than that required for *inorganic* theories. All rocks, for instance, must fall down, but not all horses have to be born with only one head. Biology includes three forms of “randomness,” which are environment, genetic mutation and free will. For example, poodles are generally friendly, but if beaten for years, will likely become aggressive. Horses are defined as having only one head, but occasionally, a two-headed mutant is born. Similarly, human beings generally prefer eating to starving – except anorexics. These exceptions do not bring down the entire science of biology. Thus, since moral theories describe mankind, they cannot be subjected to exactly the same requirements for consistency as theories describing inorganic matter.

The final test that any moral theory must pass is the criterion of empirical observation. For instance, a moral theory must explain the universal prevalence of moral beliefs among mankind, as well as the divergent results of human moral “experiments” such as fascism, communism, socialism or capitalism. It must also explain some basic facts about human society, such as the fact that state power always increases, or that propaganda tends to increase as state power increases. If it fails to explain the past, understand the present and predict the future, then it must be rejected as invalid.

#### UPB: The Practice

How does all this look in practice? Let’s look at how the requirement for *universality* affects moral theories. We shall touch here on proofs and disproofs for specific moral propositions, which we shall examine in more detail in Part Two.

If I say that gravity affects matter, it must affect *all* matter. If even one pebble proves immune to gravity, my theory is in trouble. If I propose a moral theory that argues that people should not murder, it must be applicable to *all* people. If certain people (such as soldiers) are exempt from that rule, then I have to either prove that soldiers are *not* people, or accept that my moral theory is false. There is no other possibility. On the other hand, if I propose a moral theory that argues that all people *should* murder, then I have saved certain soldiers, but condemned to evil all those *not* currently murdering someone (including those being murdered!) – which is surely incorrect.

If, to save the virtue of soldiers, I alter my theory to argue that it is moral for people to murder if someone else tells them to (a political leader, say), then I must deal with the problem of universality. If Politician A can order a soldier to murder an Iraqi, then the Iraqi must also be able to order the soldier to murder Politician A, and the soldier can also order Politician A to murder the Iraqi. The application of this theory results in a general and amoral paralysis, and thus is proven invalid.

I also cannot logically argue that is wrong for *some* people to murder, but right for *other* people to murder. Since all human beings share common physical properties and requirements, proposing one rule for one person and the *opposite* rule for another is invalid – it is like proposing a physics theory that says that some rocks fall down, while others fall up. Not only is it illogical, it contradicts an observable fact of reality, which is that human beings as a species share common characteristics, and so cannot be subjected to opposing rules. Biologists have no problems classifying certain organisms as “human” because they share common and easily identifiable characteristics – it is only moralists who seem to find this level of consistency impossible.

Furthermore, if my moral theory “proves” that the same man should not murder one day, but *should* murder the next day (say, when he steps out into the Iraqi desert), then my position is even more ludicrous. That would be equivalent to arguing that *one day a rock falls downward, and the next day it falls upward!* To call this any kind of consistent theory is to make madness sanity.

Since valid theories require *logical consistency*, a moral theory cannot be valid if it is both true and false at the same time. A moral theory that approves of stealing, for instance, faces an insurmountable logical problem. No moral theory should, if it is universally applied, directly eliminate behaviour it defines as moral while simultaneously creating behaviour it defines as *immoral*. If everyone *should* steal, then no one *will* steal – which means that the moral theory can never be practised. And *why* will no one steal? Well, because a man will only steal if he can *keep* the property he is stealing. He’s not going to bother stealing a wallet if someone else is going to immediately steal that wallet from him. Any moral theory proposing that “stealing is good” is also automatically invalid because it posits that property rights are both valid and invalid *at the same time*, and so fails the test of logical consistency. If I steal from you, I am saying that *your* property rights are invalid. However, I want to *keep* what I am stealing – and therefore I am saying that *my* property rights are valid. However, property rights cannot be both valid and invalid at the same time, and so this proposition itself must be invalid.

Similarly, any moral theory that advocates rape faces a similar contradiction. Rape can *never* be moral, since any principle that approves it automatically contradicts itself. If rape is justified on the principle that “taking pleasure is always good,” then such a principle immediately fails the test of logical consistency, since the rapist may be “taking pleasure,” but his victim certainly is *not*.[^7]

Thus subjecting moral theories to the scientific method produces results that conform to rationality, empirical observations and plain common sense. Murder, theft, arson, rape and assault are all proven immoral.[^8]

To aid in swallowing this rather large conceptual pill, below is a table that helps equate theories of physics and biology with scientific theories of universally preferable (or moral) behaviour:

Table: Theories of physics and biology and of UPB

In conclusion, it is safe to say that (a) moral rules are valid, and (b) moral theories must be subjected to the rigours of logic and evidence, just as theories of physics and biology are. Any moral theory based on non-universal or self-contradictory principles is demonstrably false.

#### UPB: The Framework

UPB can thus be seen as a framework for validating ethical theories or propositions – just as the scientific method is a framework that is used to validate scientific theories or propositions.

An example of a moral proposition is: “the initiation of the use of force is wrong.” UPB is the methodology that tests that proposition against both internal consistency and empirical observation. UPB thus first asks: *is the proposition logical and consistent?* UPB then asks: *what evidence exists for the truth of the proposition?*

To keep this book at a reasonable length, we will in general deal mostly with the first criterion of logical consistency. For the second criterion, we shall rely for evidence on the universal prohibitions across all cultures against certain actions such as rape, theft, assault and murder. Much more could be written on the historical evidence that helps support or reject various moral propositions, but we shall leave that for another time. If we establish the validity of UPB, we have achieved an enormous amount. If we do not, evidence will scarcely help us.

Let us now turn to the question of whether the UPB framework deals with matters of *ethics*, or *aesthetics*, or both.

[^7]: The same goes, of course, for murder and assault. We will be returning to these proofs – as well as a further examination of property rights – in more detail in Part Two of this book.

[^8]: Universal and positive moral rules can also be proven – i.e. the universal validity of property rights and non-violence – but we shall discuss that in Part Two.
