## Internal Consistency

如果我是一个建筑师，并计划建一个房子，我首先需要克服的困难是我是否要修房子。 如果我提出一个完全由肥皂泡建造建造的房子的美好计划，我永远都得不到佣金，因为这样的“房子”永远都无法支撑起来。

同样，如果一个工程师提出一个修建桥梁的计划，首先满足的标准是桥梁能否支撑得起来。 首先只有桥梁在物理上是可行，才会有其他考虑，比如：寿命，美观等。

随机使用材料修建桥梁或用随机的“计算”来判断它是否能支撑的起，是不合逻辑的—更不用说非生产性的了。 由于物理定律是相容而普遍的，所以比较容易在修建桥梁*之前*计算出它能否支撑起来。

在修建桥梁之前判断它的可行性有两种方法。 第一是在支持修建桥梁可行性的前提和计算中找出内部矛盾。 If there are significant errors in the calculations justifying the weight that the bridge can support, then the bridge will likely be either over-designed, or under-designed. If erroneous mathematical calculations result in a strength of minus fifty tons per square foot at any part of the bridge, then it certainly will not stand – or, if it does, its viability will be only accidental, and not reproducible.

The mathematical calculations supporting the viability of the bridge must thus be internally consistent before any other considerations can be taken into account.

In computer terms, code that does not compile cannot be tested.

This is true in the scientific world as well. Theories are always checked for internal consistency before they are submitted to empirical tests. The reason that internal consistency is so essential is that since theories claim to have value relative to reality, and reality is internally consistent, any theory that is *not* internally consistent cannot have value relative to reality.

Only *after* the internal consistency of the calculations has been established can the degree to which the bridge meets the specifications be reviewed. It is possible to write internally consistent specifications for a tiny bridge built entirely out of balsa wood, but unless the engineer is writing an article for a model rail-roading magazine, his specifications, though consistent, will fail to meet any industrial requirement.

Once we have determined that the bridge will stand, we can then determine whether or not it meets our specific needs, such as supporting the weight of pedestrians versus trains.

In the realm of economics, the same criterion applies. If my economic theory requires that prices go up and down simultaneously, then it cannot be valid, since this is impossible. Once my theory has been checked for internal consistency, I can begin to look for evidence, and/or begin using my theory to make proactive predictions.

Thus, we can see that any theory, to be valid, requires the following:

1. Internal consistency (logic).
2. External consistency (testability).

With this in mind, we can now turn to the core subject of this book.
