## 前言

在许多童话故事中，常常会出现一种有着巨大力量的可怕野兽，比如一个恶龙或蛇怪，它对周围的土地进行暴虐。当地村民在这个怪物面前发抖;他们为了安抚自己的杀人冲动，不惜牺牲自己的动物、金钱和鲜血。

大多数人在这只野兽的阴影下畏缩不前，把他们自己的恐惧称为“谨慎”，但也有一些有勇无谋的人决定反抗。日复一日，年复一年，一波又一波的充满希望的神勇斗士试图用他们的力量、美德和狡诈与这个可怕的暴君进行对抗。

屡战屡败。

这只野兽永远也无法被打败，所以村民们不能寄希望于时间来摆脱他们的暴君。这只野兽从来都不是理性的，也没有交易的欲望，因此也不可能进行任何谈判。

绝望的村民唯一的希望就是能出现一个能够打败野兽的人。

无可避免的是，当一个人脚步太快，则其他人都无法跟他保持步调一致。他是一个稳重的男孩，一个鞋匠的儿子，一个面包师的学徒，有时甚至是一个流浪儿。

这本书就是关于我个人对抗这样一只野兽的故事。

这只“野兽”是一种信仰，认为要定义一个客观、理性、世俗和科学的伦理体系是不可能的。这只“野兽”是一种错觉，仅仅为了实用主义，就认为道德必须永远迷失在上帝和政府的非理性沼泽中，但却永远缺乏合理的理由和清晰的定义。这只“野兽”是一种幻想，认为美德，我们最大的快乐，我们最深的幸福，必须被世俗的成年人抛弃，留在尘土中，被政治家、牧师和父母们所盘弄、炫耀和利用。这只“野兽”是一种迷信，认为没有父母的长篇大论，没有上帝的欺侮，也没有政府的枪，我们就无法做到理性和善良。

从苏格拉底到柏拉图，从奥奥古斯丁到休谟，再到从康德到兰德，这只野兽打倒了许多伟大的英雄。

人类付出的代价是巨大的。

因为我们仍然无法定义一个理性的普遍道德体系，我们被迫给我们的孩子讲述宗教恐怖故事，或者把枪支、监狱和军队交给一个自称为“国家”的没有灵魂控制的小垄断体系。

因为我们称之为“道德”的东西仍然是主观的，而且是“文化的”，因此我们会不可避免地依赖于欺凌、恐惧和暴力来执行社会规则。因为道德缺乏科学方法的理性基础，“道德”仍然陷入一场血腥神话的部落战争中，每一群人都为了控制人们对美德的忠诚而竭尽所能。

我们的生活离不开道德，而我们却又不能客观地定义道德-因此，我们空虚的一生总是无法摆脱自大虚伪，愤世嫉俗和虔诚的奴性。

从理性角度来说，世界上没有比这风险更高的了。在宗教和国家的战争中，因为我们未能定义客观和理性的道德规则，造成了数亿人的生命损失。

从许多方面来看，这种风险正日渐提高。

互联网信息流的增加,引起了新一代人的猜疑,即所谓的"美德",无非是他们伪善的长辈们的自私童话而已。当权者所说的虔诚的谎言, 以及那些崇拜这些人的同谋, 现在比以往任何时候都清楚。

当“真理”被披露为一种操纵；“美德”被披露为一种控制；所谓的“道德”，被揭露为一个可笑的木偶剧，目的是为了欺骗弱小和恐惧的人们，使他们被奴役。

这种认识催生了新一代的虚无主义者，就像19世纪的德国一样。这些极端的相对主义者，为那些声称任何形式的确定性的人保留了他们最尖刻的攻击。后现代的一代已经超越了他们共同历史的文化偏见，现在把所有的真理都看作是一种前司法的断言。就像那些天真的孩子们，他们都被玩世不恭的“智慧”所伤害，他们把所有的交流都看作是广告，所有的主张都看作是政治宣传，所有的道德劝诫都看作是虚伪的偷窃。

由于我们无法就一个有凝聚力的、客观的、理性的评价道德命题的框架达成一致，“道德”仍然陷于神秘主义的泥潭，它不可避免地导致了暴力的必然结果。就像在启蒙运动之前，宗教派别无休止地争夺对贵族的控制，所以现在要利用道德神话的战争和所有的强制手段来控制国家。

这只“道德”野兽在我们上方若隐若现，对我们进行了掠夺，为税收、监禁、审查和战争辩护。它在公立学校和星期天的教堂里奴役年轻人;它使穷人在福利的软福利中被困住;它甚至把未出生的人都奴役在国家债务的无底洞里。

正如我在上一本书中所写的，“真理:幻想的暴政”，就是在未经证实的道德理论的中心的最基本的谎言，这些理论总是以客观和无可辩驳的事实呈现给儿童, 而事实上它们只是文化上的偏执。科学家不需要政府或梵蒂冈的原因是科学家有一种客观的方法来解决争议:科学方法。语言不需要中央权威来指导其发展的原因是，它是一个依赖于个人对风格和效用的个人偏好的“自由市场”。

在历史上，现代道德和道德总是首先要依赖于孩子们的欺凌，其次是对成年人的威胁，因为道德就是一个伪装成美德的谎言。

事实是我们需要道德；而谎言是，神或政府认为可以理性地定义或公正地执行它。

我在这本书里的目标是定义一种方法来验证客观、一致、清晰、理性、经验和真实的道德理论。

我完全明白，在此刻，你很可能会感受到会在内心升起一股怀疑的浪潮。我完全明白，有一些人在互联网上-疯子的故乡-在某种程度上解决了这个时代的哲学问题，但这种程度不是特别高，甚至接近于零，几乎是无法区分的。

不过,也不完全是零。

### Ground Rules

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. In taking on this mammoth task – particularly in such a short book – I have set myself some basic ground rules, which are worth going over here.[^1]

1. I fully accept the Humean distinction between “is” and “ought.” Valid moral rules cannot be directly derived from the existence of anything in reality. The fact that human beings in general *prefer* to live, and must successfully interact with reality in order to do so, cannot be the basis for any valid theory of ethics. Some people clearly do not prefer to live, and steadfastly reject reality, so this definition of ethics remains subjective and conditional.
2. Ethics cannot be objectively defined as “that which is good for man’s survival.” Certain individuals can survive very well by preying on others, so this definition of ethics does not overcome the problem of subjectivism. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. I do not believe in any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. This also does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since that which is inaccessible to reason and evidence is by definition subjective.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. In this book, I start from the assumption that there is no such thing as ethics, and build a framework from there.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristotle argued that any ethical theory that can be used to prove that rape is moral must have something wrong with it, to say the least. Thus, after I have developed a framework for validating ethical theories, I run these generally accepted moral premises through that framework, to see whether or not they hold true.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Finally, I believe that any theory – especially one as fundamental as a theory of ethics – does little good if it merely confirms what everybody already knows instinctively. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

I studied the history of philosophy in graduate school, and hold a Masters degree, but I do not have a PhD in philosophy. I am far from a publicly recognised intellectual. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

It is the height of audacity to suggest to readers how to read a book, but given the challenges of the task before us, I would like to make one small suggestion before we embark.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. You might find fault with a particular logical step or metaphor, but you would already agree with the conclusion, and thus would be more prone to help correct the details rather than reject the theory as a whole.

If my task were to respond to every possible objection to every linguistic, logical and empirical step, this book would remain forever unfinished – and unread. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

I ride into battle well armed by others.
