# 结语

在相对较短的时间内，我们已经涵盖了庞大数量的观点。 哲学最大的挑战是定义一种具有普遍性，客观性且绝对的道德，不依靠于上帝或国家。 当我们依靠上帝或国家来定义道德时，道德就不再是普遍的，客观的和绝对的。 换句话说，它不再“道德”。

“上帝”和“国家”这些虚构实体的发明对回答我们关于道德的问题毫*无作用*。

我们完全明白上帝的发明并没有做什么-也什么都不会做-来回答关于生命起源，或是宇宙的问题。 要说，在回答任何问题时，“一些不可理解的存在为了不可知的目的以某些深不可测的方式做了一些不可思议的事情，”不能被考虑为任何一种理性的答案。

对理性和本质问题构成难以理解的“答案”的最大危险是它提供的是一个答案的*幻觉*，而这通常否定了对真理的追求。 此外，一个群体不可避免地联合起来捍卫并得益于这种非理性答案。 在宗教领域，这是教士阶级。 在政府领域，这是政治阶级。

当一个真实而重要的问题被一个神秘而暴力的“答案”所接受时，人类的进步就变成了回归。 如果祭司说雨是因为神而来，那么气象学的科学就不会产生。 如果疾病被认为是上帝的道德惩罚，医学科学就不会发展。 如果星星的运动被认为是神明的发条，那么物理学的科学就会停滞不前。

当对道德问题提供错误答案时，质疑这些答案必然成为一种道德犯罪。 当幻想取代好奇心时，那些从幻想中获利的人不可避免地会以暴力来捍卫他们的谎言。

而且永远，*儿童*是这些剥夺性谎言的第一受害者。

孩子们不应因为吃糖果，玩标签，或是理解二加二等于四而被欺负。 人类思想不需要通过强加恐惧，无聊，侮辱和重复来获得真相。 一个孩子不应被“教导”，这个玩具是真实的，因为如果他不*相信*这个玩具是真实的，他将永世坠入地狱。 一个孩子不应被威胁他的味蕾被原罪所诅咒只因他相信巧克力的味道很不错。

说道德之所以存在是因为上帝告诉我们道德的存在与它不存在是完全一样的。 如果你在eBay从我这里买了一个iPod，我寄给你一个空盒子，你会写信给我你的愤怒。 如果我告诉你不用担心，那个我看不见的朋友向我保证盒子里实际上有一个iPod，你会满意吗？ Would not my claim that my invisible friend tells me of the iPod’s existence be a certain proof that the iPod did not in fact exist?

If morality is justified according to the authority of a being that does not exist, then morality by definition is not justified. If I write a check that is “certified” by a bank that does not exist, then clearly my check is by definition *invalid*.

The same is true for enforcing morality through the irrational monopoly of “the state.” If we allow the existence of a government – a minority of people who claim the right to initiate the use of force, a right which is specifically denied to everyone else – then any and all moral “rules” enforced by the government are purely subjective, since the government is *by definition* based on a violation of moral rules.

If I say that I need the government to protect my property, but that the government is by definition a group of people who can violate my property rights at will, then I am caught in an insurmountable contradiction. I am saying that my property rights must be defended – and then I create an agency to defend them that can violate them at any time. This is like being so afraid of rape that I hire a bodyguard to protect me from being raped – but in the contract, I allow my bodyguard – and anyone he chooses – to rape me at will.

Because “morality” based on the state and on religion is so irrational and self-contradictory, it *requires* a social agency with a monopoly on the initiation of force to function. Since everyone is just making up “morals” and claiming absolute justification based on imaginary entities, rational negotiation and understanding remain impossible. We do not need a government because people are bad, but rather, because people are irrational, we end up with a government. False moral theories always end up requiring violence to enforce them. Moral theories are not developed in *response* to violence – false moral theories *cause* violence – in fact, *demand* violence.

The moral subjectivism and irrationality involved in answering “What is truth?” with “God,” and “What is morality?” with “government,” is so openly revealed by the framework of UPB that it is hard to imagine that this concept is not more widespread.

One central reason for this is that truly understanding UPB requires the very highest possible mental functioning. It is relatively easy to be rational; it is very difficult to think about the implicit premises of rationality, and all that they entail. It is relatively easy to debate; it is very difficult to tease out all of the implicit assumptions involved in the very act of debating.

It is easy to catch a ball – it is hard to invent the physics that explain motion *universally*.

Thinking *about* thinking is the hardest mental discipline of all.

At the beginning of this book, I talked about a “beast” that terrified and enslaved mankind. This beast is always located on a mountaintop, or in a deep cave. People are afraid of the beast in the world, which is why the beast has never been defeated.

The beast has never been defeated because the beast is an illusion.

The beast cannot be defeated in the world, because the beast is within ourselves.

The collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone,” where morality magically reverses itself, called “the government” is exactly the same as the collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone” called “God” where *reality* reverses itself.

If we define “morality” according to the subjective fantasies of mere mortals, then it will forever remain under the manipulative control of power-hungry tyrants. Since God does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to God is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Since “the state” does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to government is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Until we can define an objective and rational morality that is free from the subjective whims of each individual, we will never make the kind of progress that we need to as a species.

Morality, like physics, biology, geology and chemistry, must join the realm of the sciences if we are to flourish – and indeed, perhaps, to survive at all.

However, if we can sustain our courage, it is this discipline alone that can set us, and our children – and all humanity in the future – free from the tyranny of the greatest beast: our own moral illusions.
