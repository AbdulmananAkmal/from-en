供求曲线相交的标准经济模型的局限性表明：一个商品的数量与均衡价格（或最优价格）。 作为奥地利人很清楚地知道，它们的局限性在于不切实际的假设。 脱离现实世界的假设无非是不行的，尤其是如果用模型来解释与假设不相符的现实世界。 简化的经济模型往往揭示了关于经济是如何运行的重要事实，应用简化的经济模型也往往导致了许多经济学家误入歧途。

# 生产者的成本增加不会引起价格增加

最近一[集经济学播客](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/02/tom*wainwright.html)中，由主办人罗伯茨.拉斯关于*经济学家*汤姆.韦恩赖特最近的一本书*[毒品经济学](https://www.amazon.com/Narconomics-How-Run-Drug-Cartel/dp/1610395832/?tag=misesinsti-20)*采访了记者和作者本人，此书详细阐述了简单的经济学101逻辑是如何被误导的。 虽然这一段很值得一听，讨论内容也有趣而详实，但在一开始最重要的部分就致力于讨论非法药品的价值这一问题。 罗伯茨和韦恩赖特一开始就陷入了讨论的困境：讨论本身就是错误的，它可能会误导听众，这说明了一个显而易见的“悖论“和作者”奇异的“观点。

韦恩赖特的观点是这么说的：政府致力于缩减非法药品的供给不会影响预期价格。 他用艺术品的例子来说明这一观点，事实上这个例子比他认为的还要好。 他所说的例子是这样的：如果涂料被用于制作出一幅画，这幅画的成本是50美金，这幅画售价在100万美金，假设将一盒涂料的价格增加100%，这幅画的成本是100美金，那么这幅画的价格也会翻倍——下一副画将预期售价为200万美金。 但是事实并非如此，这个画家下一副画的价格可能仍然是100万美金，反映出已增加的花费是1,000,050美金。

这个例子说明了在非法药品“交易”的矛盾是怎么回事，特别说明了为什么政府试图影响供给量却没有效果。 正如韦恩赖特所说，就算成功实施措施缩减了供给量，也不会对消费者增加最终价格（这是部分所述理由）。 这有趣而出乎预料的结果表明，政府应该“投资”在减少对非法药品的需求量上。

争论的问题在于，它依赖于用于大学新生经济学101课程中的简单的供求关系模型的均衡分析。 And it doesn’t actually apply here. Had the paintings or illegal drugs markets been in equilibrium, there might indeed be a paradox. But this is hardly the case, *especially* in these markets.

Also, in a state of equilibrium costs perfectly reflect social opportunity costs, and “perfect” competition brings price and cost together so that no one is able to make economic profits. In other words, there is no difference between price and cost. There is, consequently, no reason to in this theory distinguish between them temporally or causally — they appear to be determined instantaneously and accurately. This is also how they are treated in various economics models that students learn to “maximize.”

# Price Drives Cost  — Not the Other Way Around

As we know, however, the real market process is driven by *entrepreneurship* and market actors are not just responsive agents. Entrepreneurs do not live in equilibrium, and they base their business decisions on their own appraisal of the different actions and their imagined outcomes. In this real market, price drives cost  — not the other way around. Indeed, Carl Menger noted that the value of any production good is derived from consumers’ valuation of the consumption goods that it produces, not the other way around. This is also core to for example Mises’s argument about economic calculation.

What this means is that entrepreneurs assume (*choose*, even) costs based on the anticipated revenue of their imagined product. The reason an expensive good is produced at high cost is that those high costs can be covered by the anticipated price that it can be sold for. It doesn’t mean that entrepreneurs choose high costs for the fun of it, but that they motivate a certain level of costs based on the anticipated price — and that price is really dependent only on consumer valuation of the final good.

In imperfect markets, this means there can be high markups that offer entrepreneurs enormous profits. But this is also what lures other entrepreneurs to enter this particular market, so where there are no significant barriers to entry profits will tend to get squeezed until they reach the standard market rate of return. In this process, costs are pushed down but consumer good prices even more so, thereby making consumers the ultimate winners of this process.

So it is not in any sense a paradox that the market price of a box of paint has very little to do with the final price of the painting. The box of paint is traded in the market at a price that partly is derived from the anticipated value of paintings. Similarly, the coca leaves that will eventually end up in a nostril on Wall Street *are valued because the end product is valued.*

If government burns half of those fields, this will not lead to a doubling of the final good’s price. Instead, it will increase the costs that need to be covered by producers to make the final good available in consumer markets. As margins are enormous in illegal drug production and distribution, primarily as a result of government repression, producers don’t think twice to continue just like before without changing prices: it only causes a small dent in their income.

In Wainwright’s example, a kilo of cocaine, with a market value of $100,000 when sold in “tiny portions,” is produced from a ton of fresh coca leaf sold at a price of $500. The refined product sells at $1,000 in Columbia, and to “distributors” in the United states for $15–20,000. In this situation, if the fields of some coca farmers are burned, those farmers lose all their revenue while prices of the remaining product could potentially be bid up (assuming some form of market). How much those prices are bid up depends on the [reservation prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation*price) of existing cocaine producers and the chance of new entrants. It does not cause a proportional ripple effect throughout the supply chain.

This is easy to see if we adopt the Austrian view that pricing of production goods is done “backward” through entrepreneurial bidding aiming for anticipated consumer prices. But using the supply-and-demand schedule for equilibrium prices can produce a fundamentally flawed analysis — even by those who recognize that the assumptions are unrealistic (which Roberts naturally does).

这并不是说可卡因供应链中的价格不是某种均衡价格。 部分均衡的假设不是使分析有缺陷的原因。 The error lies in failing to recognize that cost (that is, the existence and shape of supply) is a function of the anticipated price (demand) of the final good.

由此看来，特别是在短期内，要素价格的变化不一定反映在消费品的价格上。 相反，他们将反映在生产商的利润率上，从而导致他们改变自己的行为。
