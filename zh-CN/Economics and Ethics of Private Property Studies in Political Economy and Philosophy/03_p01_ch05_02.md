#### 利息

钱是“中性的”，对利息也是。然而，与金钱不同，利息在实践上是与就业和社会产品相关的。

由于金钱是不确定性的结果，所以利息来自于时间偏好，这是作为不确定性的行动的必要条件（从稍後会解释的某种意义上说，更是如此）。在演戏中，演员不仅总是旨在取代一个不那么令人满意的事态，因此表现出更多而不是更少的物品的偏好；他总是会考虑将来何时目标能达成（要完成它们所需的时间）以及物品的可使用持续时间，因此每一项行动都表明普遍偏好，选先而不选后来的商品，以及选更耐用的商品。每个行动都需要一段时间才能实现目标；既然人总要消费一些东西，不能完全不消费，并且时间总是稀缺。因此，在其他条件相同时，现在或早期的商品，总是比将来或以后的商品更为重要。[^11] 事实上，如果人不受时间偏好的约束，唯一的约束条件是以多为优，无论这些方法所需时间长短如何，他总是会选择那些能够按输入而产生最大产量。例如，鲁滨逊不是首先编造一个渔网，而是立即开始建造一艘渔船，这是最有经济效益的捕鱼方法。包括鲁滨逊在内的任何人都免不了这样做，这就明显地表明，人类只能“以一种不同的方式来重视某一段时间之值，按离决定行动的时刻之远近。”[^12]  

因此，如果受到时间偏好的限制，人们因预期增加未来货物的数量时，才会以现货来换取期货。 时间偏好的比率可能因人而异，也会因时间而改变，但对每个人来说永远是正面的影响，同时决定了现货比期货的优势高度，并其储蓄和投资的数额。市场利率是所有个体时间偏好率的总和，也就是说，反映了社会时间偏好率，并且平衡了社会储蓄（即提供用于兑换未来商品的现有商品）和社会 投资（即能够产生未来回报的现货需求）。

没有以前的储蓄就没有可供应的可贷资金，也就是说，可得放弃消费一些目前的商品。 此外，如果没有人认为有任何机会有效利用现有产品，就不会存在对可贷资金的需求（即投资它们以产生超过当前投入的未来产品）。事实上，如果所有现在的商品都被消费了，并且没有投资于耗时的生产过程，那么就没有利息或时间偏好率，或者说，利率将是无限高的。身处在伊甸园之外，这将等于 去寻求一种原始的生存方式，他们只能生活在现实中，只能用赤手空拳来满足现实，渴望得到即时的满足。

只有当人们认识到间接的丶更迂回的丶更长的生产过程比直接丶短期投入可以产出更多或更好的回报，可贷资金的供给和需求才会出现—这就是人性[^13]；并且可以通过积蓄来积累为所有现有物品的数量，这些需求提供的物品来满足在长时间的等待丶比通过采用生产过程更为耗时的需求。[^14]

只要情况如此，资本的形成和积累就会继续下去。 与其受到即时满足的生产过程的支持和参与，生产的原始因素丶土地和劳动力，都受到生产过剩，而不是消费或生产资本货物过程的支持。除了作为最终（消费者）产品的中间产品之外，这些产品没有任何价值。 换句话说，它们的价值在于拥有它们的人可以更有效地使用它们来生产其他资本货物。资本货物的价值（价格）超过了生产所需的原始因素费用的总和，这是由于时间差异和时间偏好的普遍事实。这是为时间所支付的价格; 为更接近完成的最终目标，而不是从起步点重来。由于时间偏好，最终产出的价值必须超过其生产要素（为资本品和所有劳动力支付的价格）所费用的总和。

时间偏好率越低，那么资本形成的过程就越早实现，并且它会加快生产的循环结构。资本货物积累和循环生产结构的任何增加，反过来都会提高劳动力的边际生产率。这导致就业和/或工资率增加，并且在任何情况下（即使劳动力供给曲线随着工资增加而向后倾斜），工资总额也会增加。[^15] 然后，随着资本货物数量的增加，有更高收入的打工仔将导致总体增长—未来—社会产品，最终，在雇员之后，资本和土地所有者的实际收入也增加。 虽然利息（时间偏好）因此与就业和社会收入有着直接的关系，但它与金钱没有任何关系。可以肯定的是，在货币经济中，还存在着社会时间偏好率的货币表现。 然而，这并没有改变事实，即利息和金钱是系统性独立和不相关的，利益是一个“真实”而不是货币现象。事实上，在梦想平衡的地方，那里不再需要钱，因为未来的按定义来说，一切都是确定的，而且所有的不确定因素都被消除了，没有人会需要持有现金（现金的唯一目的，既不是它的生产性或消费性，而是为将来尚未知道的购买来作准备）。然而，时间偏好和利息不可能被认为即将消失。 即使在均衡状态下，现有的资本结构需要随着时间的推移而不断维持 (so as to prevent it from gradually becoming consumed in the even course of an endlessly repeated pattern of productive operations). There can be no such maintenance, however, without ongoing savings and reinvestments: and there can be no such things as these without the expectation of a positive rate of interest. (Indeed, if the rate of interest paid were zero, capital consumption would result, and one would move out of equilibrium.)[^16]

Matters become somewhat more complex under conditions of uncertainty, with money actually in use, but the praxeological independence of money and interest remains fully intact. Under these conditions, man invariably has three instead of two alternatives as to how to allocate his current income. He must not only decide how much to allocate to the purchase of present goods and how much to future goods (i.e., how much to consume and how much to invest), but also how much to keep in cash. There are no other alternatives. Yet while man must at all times make adjustments concerning three margins at once, invariably the outcome is determined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. The consumption/investment proportion is determined by time preference. The source of the demand for cash, on the other hand, is the utility attached to money (i.e., its usefulness in allowing immediate purchases of directly serviceable goods at uncertain future dates). Both factors can vary, independent of one another.

If the supply of money changes, or if the demand for money changes with a given social stock of money, the purchasing power of money will also change. However, aside from causing changes in relative incomes, no such changes in a money unit’s purchasing power would have any effect on overall real income. Incomes in terms of money increase or decrease, yet the purchasing power of money correspondingly falls or rises, leaving real income unchanged. Or, with money incomes unchanged, more or less of it will be held in cash (hoarded), but then the purchasing power of money correspondingly rises or falls, once again leaving the real income purchased with a smaller or larger sum of money unaltered. It is this real income, however, not money as such, to which a man’s time preference schedule is related, and in light of which his effective rate of time preference is determined. Since real income does not change through all these monetary changes, there is no reason to suppose that the rate of time preference will. If, for instance, the Keynesian nightmare of increased hoarding becomes reality and prices generally fall while the purchasing power of money correspondingly rises, this will leave the real investment/consumption proportion entirely unaffected. Unless the time preference schedule is assumed to have changed at the same time, the additional hoards will be drawn from funds that formerly were spent on consumption and from funds that formerly went into investment in the same pre-established proportion, so as to leave real consumption and real investment at precisely their old levels. However, if time-preference is assumed to change concomitantly, then everything is possible. Indeed, if the additional hoards come exclusively from previous consumption spending, an increased demand for money can go hand in hand even with a fall in the rate of interest and increased investment. Yet this is due not to changes in the demand for money but exclusively to a change (a fall) in the time preference schedule.[^17]

#### The Capitalist Process

With the division of labor established and extended to its ultimate limit via the development of a universal medium of exchange, the process of economic development is essentially determined by time preference.

To be sure, there are other factors that are important: the quality and quantity of the population, the endowment with nature-given resources, and the state of technology. Yet of these, the quality of a people is largely beyond anyone’s control and must be taken as a given: the quantity of a population may or may not advance economic development, depending on whether the population is below or above its optimum size for a given-sized territory: and nature-given resources or technological know-how can only have an economic impact if discovered and utilized. To do this, though, there must be prior savings and investment. It is not the availability of resources and technical or scientific knowledge that imposes limits on economic advancement: rather, it is time preference that imposes limits on the exploitation of actually available resources as well as on the utilization of existing knowledge (and also on scientific progress for that matter, insofar as research activities, too, must be supported by saved-up funds).

Thus, the only viable path toward economic growth is through savings and investment, governed as they are by time preference. Ultimately there is no way toward prosperity except through an increase in the per capita quota of invested capital. This is the only way to increase the marginal productivity of labor and only if this is done can future income rise in turn. With real incomes rising, the effective rate of time preference falls (without, however, ever reaching zero or even becoming negative), adding still further increased doses of investment, and setting in motion an upward spiraling process of economic development.

There is no reason to suppose that this process should come to a halt short of reaching the Garden of Eden where all scarcity has disappeared—unless people deliberately choose otherwise and begin to value additional leisure more highly than any further increase in real incomes. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the process of capitalist development would be anything but smooth and that the economy would flexibly adjust not only to all monetary changes but to all changes in the social rate of time preference as well. Of course, so long as the future is uncertain, there will be entrepreneurial errors, losses, and bankruptcies. But no systematic reason exists why this should cause more than temporary disruptions, or why these disruptions should exceed, or drastically fluctuate around, a “natural rate” of business failures.[^18]

Matters become different only if an extra-market institution such as government is introduced. It not only makes involuntary unemployment possible, as explained above: the very existence of an agency that can effectively claim ownership over resources which it has neither homesteaded, produced, nor contractually acquired, also raises the social rate of time preference for homesteaders, producers, and contractors, and hence creates involuntary impoverishment, stagnation, or even regression. It is only through government that mankind can be stopped on its natural course toward a gradual emancipation from scarcity long before ever reaching the point of a voluntarily chosen zero-growth.[^19] And it is in the presence alone of a government, that the capitalist process can possibly take on a cyclical (rather than a smooth) pattern, with busts following booms. Exempt from the rules of private property acquisition and transfer, government naturally desires a monopoly over money and banking and wants nothing better than to engage in fractional reserve (deposit) banking—in nontechnical terms: monopolistic counterfeiting—so as to enrich itself at the expense of others through the much less conspicuous means of fraud rather than through outright confiscation.[^20] Boom and bust cycles are the outcome of fraudulent fractional reserve banking. If and insofar as the newly created counterfeit money enters the economy as additional supplies on the credit market, the rate of interest will have to fall below what it otherwise would have been. Credit must become cheaper. Yet at a lower price more credit is taken, and more resources then are invested in the production of future goods (instead of being used for present consumption) than otherwise would have been. The roundaboutness of the entire production structure is lengthened. In order to complete all investment projects that now are underway, more time is needed than that required to complete those begun before the credit expansion. All the goods which would have been created without credit expansion must be produced; plus those that are newly added. For this to be possible, however, more capital is required. The larger amount of future goods can only be produced successfully if additional savings provide for a fund of means of sustenance sufficiently large to bridge, and carry workers through, the longer waiting time. But, by assumption, no such increase in savings has taken place. The lower interest rate is not the result of a larger supply of capital goods. The social rate of time preference has not changed at all. It is solely the result of counterfeit money entering the economy through the credit market. It follows logically that it must be considered impossible to successfully complete all investment projects underway after a credit expansion due to a systematic lack of real capital. Projects will have to be liquidated so as to shorten the overall production structure and to readjust it to an unchanged rate of social time preference and the corresponding real investment-consumption proportion.[^21]

These cyclical movements can neither be avoided by expecting them (according to the motto “a cycle anticipated is a cycle avoided”): They are the praxeologically necessary consequence of additional counterfeit credit being successfully placed. Once this is the case, a boom-bust cycle is inevitable, regardless of what actors correctly or incorrectly believe or expect. The cycle is induced by a monetary change, but it takes effect in the realm of “real” phenomena and will be a “real” cycle no matter what beliefs people happen to hold.[^22]

Nor can it be realistically expected that the inevitable cyclical movements resulting from an expansion of credit will ever come to a halt: So long as an extra-market institution like government is in control of money, a permanent series of cyclical movements will mark the process of economic development. For through the creation of fraudulent credit, a government can engender a smooth and highly inconspicuous income and wealth redistribution in its own favor. There is no reason (short of angelic assumptions) to suppose that it would ever deliberately stop using this magic wand merely because credit expansion has the “unfortunate” side-effect of business cycles.
