如果考虑到对货币资产征税过于常见的情况，那么就不难证明这些结论的有效性。这类资产只能被获得和持有, 因为他们可以在未来的日期购买其他有价值的资产。他们根本没有自己的内在的使用价值（就像法定货币一样），或者说与交换值相比，这样的使用价值是微不足道的（金钱也有一个黄金标准—虽然小—即商品价值）。相反，附加给他们的价值是由他们未来的购买力决定的。然而，如果说金钱的价值由代表其他未来可利用的资产组成，那么征税钱影响就变得清晰了。最重要的是，随着休闲或消费边际效用的增加，这种税收增加了这些未来资产的边际效用。激励机制的这种变化，转化为一个参与者在更短时间的生产过程中更快地获得这些资产的尝试。目前唯一的生产过程，比那些通过早期获得的钱间接获得未来资产的生产过程，即通过直接的交易获得的过程，还要短。因此，税收意味着货货交易将会被越来越多的货币交易方式取代。但是，越来越多地诉诸物物交换是向原始经济和野蛮经济的倒退。正是因为为易货目的生产产生了极低的产出，以致人类实际上超过了这一发展阶段，反而越来越多地诉诸和扩大了生产间接交换的目的，虽然需要更长的等待期，但会使更多和不同的资产在现金关系中得到更大的回报。每一项征税行为都意味着在这个过程中倒退了一步。它减少了产出，缩小了劳动分工的范围，并导致了社会和经济一体化的减少（应当注意到，如果不是间接货币交换机构的话，这可能永远不会成为世界性的）。

此外，人们越来越倾向于采用直接而非间接的交换机制，而不是通过强制没收资金，这也对实现货币本身的方法产生了非常重要的影响。就如同非货币资产一样，货币的边际效用增加和休闲消费的增加，也使得用更少的时间来获得资金变得更有吸引力。在互惠互利的交易框架内，不是以价值生产性的努力等换取回报，税收提高了人们更快、更直接地获得回报的动力，而不需要通过这种迂回曲折的方法来生产和承包。一方面, 这意味着一个人会更频繁地尝试通过把钱藏在收税员身上来增加自己的货币资产。另一方面，在通过强制扣押来获得金钱的过程中，会出现一种日益增长的趋势—要么以非法的形式被称为“窃取”，或者以是合法的方式，参与一种叫做“政治”的游戏。[^9]

在完成了对税收影响的一般经济分析之后，今天的经济学教科书的作者们一般都不愿意讨论税收的影响，现在让我来谈谈他们通常对税收的影响所说的税务问题。根据我们以前的分析, 我们很容易发现这些账目中的致命缺陷。事实上，如果一个人不去学习这些基本知识，那么他就很容易在处理细节问题上犯错误，这几乎是意料之中的事。

关于税收问题的标准解释，最常见的例子是消费税和营业税：[^10]假设消费税或营业税被征收。谁必须承担这个责任？这是公认的—我当然无意反驳这一问题的有效性—从某种意义上说，消费者必须首当其冲，而且往往如此。无论这种税的具体后果是什么，消费者都必须为同一货品付出更高的价钱，而他们的生活水平亦会因此而受到损害，或者，税收对生产者造成更高的成本，而消费者则会因产出较低而受到惩罚。然而，正是由于这一点，我们将不得强烈反对，并且争辩这样一个论点：税收的征收是否损害了前者或后者的消费者是一个开放的经验问题，答案取决于对纳税产品的需求弹性。如果需求不够弹性，生产者就会以更高的价格将整个负担转嫁到消费者身上。如果它是高度弹性的，那么生产者将不得不以较高的生产成本的形式吸收税收，如果需求曲线的某些部分是非弹性的或者另一种弹性（据称是最常见的情况），那么负担将毫无缘由地被分享，其中一部分被转移到消费者身上，另一个落在生产者身上。

这种论点有何不妥？虽然它的措辞与我先前的分析中所用的不同，但我们很难注意到，它仅仅是在一个更具体的层面上对讨论的重新陈述，这在更普遍的层面上已经被证明是错误的：税收可能会或者可能不会降低生产产出的论题；税收与生产性产出之间没有必要的联系；而且, 在生产保持不变的情况下, 税收可能完全影响消费, 这一点有经验主义的嫌疑。假设，正如税收影响教科书中所描述的那样，税收可以完全或部分地转移到消费者身上，对消费者来说，仅仅说税收可能不会对生产产生负面影响。因为如果有可能将任何一笔税收转移到消费者身上，那么这笔金额就代表了 "非生产税收"，这是一种专门针对消费的税。[^11]

In order to refute the typical textbook analysis, one could simply go back to our previous discussion that resulted in the conclusion that any tax imposed on people constrained by time preference must negatively affect production above and beyond any negative consequences that it implies for consumption. However, I will choose a somewhat different route of argument here in order to make essentially the same point and thereby establish the more specific thesis that no amount of any tax can be shifted onto consumers. To assume otherwise is to assume something manifestly impossible.

The absurdity of the tax-forward-shifting doctrine becomes clear as soon as one tries to apply it to the case of a single actor who continuously acts in both roles—that of a producer and a consumer. For such a producer-consumer, the doctrine amounts to this proposition: If he is faced with an increase in the costs of attaining some future good—an increase, that is, that he himself perceives as a cost-increasing event—then he shifts these higher costs onto himself in such a way that he responds by attaching a correspondingly higher value to the good to be obtained, thereby restoring his old profit-margin, thus leaving his role as producer unchanged and unimpaired, and requiring restrictive adjustments exclusively in his role as a consumer. Or, formulated even more drastically, insofar as his value-productive efforts are concerned, a tax does not make any difference for an individual, because he just starts liking the to-be-produced good correspondingly more.

Plain reasoning reveals that what generates such absurdity is a fundamental conceptual confusion: The forward-shifting doctrine arises from not recognizing that in one’s analysis one must assume that demand is given—and that this must be assumed because it in fact is given at any point in time. Any analysis that loses track of this is flawed, for if one were to assume that demand had changed, then everything would be possible: production might increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. If I am a producer of tea and tea is taxed and if it is assumed that the demand schedule for tea rises concurrently, then, naturally, it is possible that people are now willing to pay a higher price for tea than previously. Yet this is obviously not a forward shifting of the tax but the result of a change in demand. To present this possibility under the heading of tax-incidence analysis is plain nonsense: it is in fact an analysis of the entirely different question of how prices are affected by changes in demand and has nothing whatsoever to do with the effects of taxation. The confusion here is on as grand a scale as that which one would encounter if someone were to “refute” the statement that one apple and another make two by saying “No, I have just added another apple, and look, there are not two but three apples here.” It is hard to get away with such nonsense in math; in economics a doctrine hardly less absurd is the orthodoxy.

Yet if one is logically committed to assuming demand to be given whenever one tries to answer the question whether or not a tax can be shifted forward, every tax must be interpreted as an event that exclusively affects the supply side: it reduces the supplies at the disposal of suppliers.[^12] Any other conclusion would amount to a denial of what had been assumed from the outset—that a tax had indeed been imposed and perceived as such by producers. To say that only the supply curve is shifted whenever a tax is extracted (while the demand curve remains the same as before) is to say nothing else than that the entire tax-burden must in fact be absorbed by the suppliers. To be sure, the leftward shift of the supply curve would cause prices to rise and consumers would naturally be harmed by having to pay these higher prices and by only being able to afford a smaller amount of goods at such a price.[^13] Yet that consumers will invariably be hurt by taxes has of course never been doubted as one should recall. However, it is a misconception to think that this higher price is a shifting of the tax burden from producers to consumers. Rather, consumers are hurt here “only” by harm being done to producers who, despite higher prices charged for their supplies, must bear the brunt.[^14] One must ask oneself why, if an entrepreneur could indeed shift any amount of the tax-burden away from himself and onto consumers, he would not have already done so by voluntarily imposing a tax on himself instead of waiting for the actual coercive tax to come along! The answer is clear: At all times he is constrained in his price-setting activity by the actual given demand. The price set by any entrepreneur is set with the expectation that a price higher than the one actually chosen would yield a lower total revenue. Otherwise, if he expected a higher price to bring about a larger revenue he would raise it. As long as an entrepreneur expects the demand to be inelastic within the region of any price-range under consideration, he will take advantage of this and choose the higher price. He stops raising prices and settles for a specific one because his expectations are reversed and he anticipates the demand curve above this price to be elastic. These expectations regarding inelastic and elastic portions of the demand curve are not at all changed if the entrepreneur is faced with a tax. Then as now he expects higher prices to produce revenue losses. Thus, it is obviously out of the question to argue that he could escape the burden of the tax. In fact, if as a consequence of the reduced supply the price now rises, this upward movement must be into an elastic portion of the demand curve, and the entrepreneur thus must assumedly pay the full price of it in the form of reduced revenue. Any other conclusion is logically flawed. Only if the entrepreneur expects a change in demand occurring simultaneously with taxation could he change his price without thereby incurring losses. If he expects demand to have increased, for instance, such that there will now be an inelastic rather than an elastic stretch of the demand curve above the presently going price, he will be able to raise it without punishment. Again, this is not a forward shifting of the tax. This is increased demand. With or without the tax the entrepreneur would have acted in precisely the same way. The tax has nothing to do with such price changes. In any case, the tax must be paid exclusively and in full by the suppliers of the taxed goods.[^15]

[^9]: Here once again what has already been explained in a somewhat different connection in note 7 above becomes evident: why it is a fundamental mistake to think that taxation might have a “neutral” effect on production such that any “negative” effects on tax*payers* may be compensated by corresponding “positive” effects on tax *spenders*. What is overlooked in this sort of reasoning is that the introduction of taxation not only implies favoring nonproducers at the expense of producers. It simultaneously changes, for producers and nonproducers alike, the cost attached to different methods of attaining an income, for it is then relatively less costly to attain an additional income through nonproductive means, i.e., not through actually producing more goods but by participating in the process of noncontractual acquisitions of already produced goods. If such a different incentive structure is applied to a given population, then the length of the production structure will necessarily be shortened, and a decrease in the output of goods produced must result.

[^12]: Baumol and Blinder, *Economics: Principles and Policy*, p. 636, present the *demand* curve as changing in response to a tax.

[^13]: To avoid any misunderstanding then: Insofar as the textbook analyses of tax-incidence point out this fact they are of course entirely correct. It is the interpretation of this phenomenon they give which is fundamentally confused!

[^14]: See on this point also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 809.

[^15]: Should a tax not immediately affect supply at all, as can happen in the short run, then it follows from the above analysis that the price charged will not change at all. For to raise it in response to the tax would once again imply pushing it into an elastic region of the demand curve. In the long run the supply will have to be relatively reduced and prices must move into this region. In any case, no forward shifting takes place. See on this also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 807ff.; idem, *Power and Market*, pp. 88ff.
