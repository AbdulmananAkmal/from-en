Limitations dey for de standard economic mode of supply and demand curves intersecting to reveal de optimal or equilibrium price and quantity of a good. Those limitations, as Austrians dey well aware, dey due to unrealistic. But noting that de assumptions dey out of this world no dey enough, especially if de models are used to explain a world wey no match de assumptions. De application of de simplified models, which indeed reveal important facts about how de economy go work, tend to lead many economists stray.

# Increasing Costs to Producers Does Not Increases Prices

A [recent EconTalk Episode](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/02/tom*wainwright.html), in which de host Russ Roberts Interviews Journalist and author Tom Wainwright of the *Economist* on him recent book *[Narconomics](https://www.amazon.com/Narconomics-How-Run-Drug-Cartel/dp/1610395832/?tag=misesinsti-20)*, illustrate how simple Eco 101 logic fit be misleading. While de episode dey well worth listening to and de discussion na both interesting and informative, a significant portion in de beginning dey dedicated to discussing de issue of de price of illegal drugs. Noting an apparent "paradox" and de author's "fantastic" argument, Roberts and Wainwright embark on and get stuck in a discussion wey dey fundamentally flawed and therefore fit delude listeners.

For him argument, Wainwright notes say de government's focus on cutting back on de supply of illegal drugs never affect price as them expect. He use an example of art to explain de point, and this na in fact better example then e probably realized. Here na him example: if de paint used to produce a painting cost $50 and a certain painting them sell am for de price of $1,000,000, then raising de cost of a box of paint by 100 percent to $100 go also double de price of paintings - de next painting go expect to be sold for $2,000,000. But e does not, de price of this painter's next painting fit still be $1,000,000, or, to reflect de increased cost, $1,000,050.

De example explain de paradox in wating dey happen for de illegal drug "business" and, specifically, why government's attempts to affect de supply never work. Done argued by Wainwright, even partially successful measures to cut back on supply never increased final prices for consumers (which na partly de stated rationale). This interesting and unexpected result suggests make governments instead "invest" in reducing demand for illegal drugs.

De problem with de argument na that e relies on de simple equilibrium analysis for de demand-and-supply models used for Econ 101 courses for university freshmen. And e no actually apply here. Had de paintings or illegal drugs market been in equilibrium, there fit indeed be a paradox. But this is hardly de care, *especialy* in dis markets.

Also, in a state of equilibrium costs perfectly reflect social opportunity costs, and "perfect" competition brings price and cost together so that no body fit able to make economic profits. In other words, there is no difference between price and cost. Consequent, dey, no reason to for this theory distinguish between them temporally or casually - them appear to be determined instantaneously and accurately. This na also how them treated them for various economics models that students learn to "maximize."

# Price Drivers Cost - Not the Other Way Around

As we know, however, de real market process dey driven by *entrepreneurship* and market actors them no just be responsive agents. Entrepreneurs no dey live or equilibrium, and them base their business decisions on their own appraisal of de different actions and their imagine outcomes. For this real market, price drives cost - not de other way around. Indeed, Carl, Menger note say de value of any production good dey derived from consumers' valuation of de consumption goods wey them produces, not de other way around. This is also core to for example Mises's argument about economic calculation.

Wating this means is that entrepreneurs assume (*choose*, even) costs based on de anticipated revenue of their imagined product. The reason an expensive good is produced at high cost is that those high costs can be covered by the anticipated price that it can be sold for. It doesn’t mean that entrepreneurs choose high costs for the fun of it, but that they motivate a certain level of costs based on the anticipated price — and that price is really dependent only on consumer valuation of the final good.

In imperfect markets, this means there can be high markups that offer entrepreneurs enormous profits. But this is also what lures other entrepreneurs to enter this particular market, so where there are no significant barriers to entry profits will tend to get squeezed until they reach the standard market rate of return. In this process, costs are pushed down but consumer good prices even more so, thereby making consumers the ultimate winners of this process.

So it is not in any sense a paradox that the market price of a box of paint has very little to do with the final price of the painting. The box of paint is traded in the market at a price that partly is derived from the anticipated value of paintings. Similarly, the coca leaves that will eventually end up in a nostril on Wall Street *are valued because the end product is valued.*

If government burns half of those fields, this will not lead to a doubling of the final good’s price. Instead, it will increase the costs that need to be covered by producers to make the final good available in consumer markets. As margins are enormous in illegal drug production and distribution, primarily as a result of government repression, producers don’t think twice to continue just like before without changing prices: it only causes a small dent in their income.

In Wainwright’s example, a kilo of cocaine, with a market value of $100,000 when sold in “tiny portions,” is produced from a ton of fresh coca leaf sold at a price of $500. The refined product sells at $1,000 in Columbia, and to “distributors” in the United states for $15–20,000. In this situation, if the fields of some coca farmers are burned, those farmers lose all their revenue while prices of the remaining product could potentially be bid up (assuming some form of market). How much those prices are bid up depends on the [reservation prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation*price) of existing cocaine producers and the chance of new entrants. It does not cause a proportional ripple effect throughout the supply chain.

This is easy to see if we adopt the Austrian view that pricing of production goods is done “backward” through entrepreneurial bidding aiming for anticipated consumer prices. But using the supply-and-demand schedule for equilibrium prices can produce a fundamentally flawed analysis — even by those who recognize that the assumptions are unrealistic (which Roberts naturally does).

This is not to say that the prices within the cocaine supply chain are not some form of equilibrium prices. The assumption of partial equilibrium is not what makes the analysis flawed. The error lies in failing to recognize that cost (that is, the existence and shape of supply) is a function of the anticipated price (demand) of the final good.

From this follows that changes in factor prices are not necessarily reflected in prices of consumer goods, especially in the short term. Rather, they will be reflected in the profit margins of producers, and can thus cause them to change their behavior.
