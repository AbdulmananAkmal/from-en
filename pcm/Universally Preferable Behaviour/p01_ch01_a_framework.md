## Framework for ethics dem

Ethical propositions dey different from dem oda types of knowledge statements. If i talk say, “I like jazz,” dat one fit be true talk or make im be lie, but e no dey binding to u for any way. Ma own like for jazz na just talk of wetin I gbafun; based on my talk so, e no dey incumbent ontop u say make u like jazz or make u no like am.

Similarly, if i talk say “I like vegetables,” dat one too na just ma talk of wetin I like. However, if I talk say, “vegetables na healthy food,” den I don comot from ma own talk com enta talk wey be objective fact. E dey different from “I like ice cream,” and, “Ice cream get milk inside.”  

D fundamental difference wey dey between d talk *preference* and talk *fact* na say talk of facts dey objective, testable - and dey binding. If u value truth so, e dey incumbent ontop u make u agree say ice cream get milk inside, once wey dem don prove am.[^1]

If I talk say d world dey round, and I com give una plenty proof for wetin I talk, No be u go com determine for ur self say d talk dey true. If I fit prove am say d world dey round, den u dey bound to agree say na true, unless if u wan reject d reason and evidence dem as criteria for truth.

If I agree say dem mathematical laws dey ogbonge, I no fit arbitrarily reject a mathematical proof wey go in line wit dem laws. If I go *reject* dat kyn proof, I no fit claim say I wan accept d ogbonge of dem mathematical laws. Say I agree to dis laws mean say I dey *bound* to agree say dose proofs wey go in line wit dis laws na ogbonge. D rejection of one proof wey go in line wit normal standards na a rejection of normal standards as a whole so.

D scientific method, wey dey normal itself, and dem mathematical laws na all of dem be examples of *objective* criteria wey dem dey use establish d truth for a proposition. No be my opinion say two and two na im turn four - if u com also accept say na two and two dey turn four, you no dey subject urself to ma own just opinion, but na to a normal truth.

### Truth wey dey Objective

A central challenge wey we dey use sabi d nature of truth na d realisation say “truth” no dey exist for d world for d same way wey rock or tree dey exist.

D concept wey be “truth” na necessarily a relative term - though dat one no mean subjective or arbitrary term. D concept wey be “health” na relative term too - we compare “health” to sickness, and to dem relative standards of health too. Wetin dem dey call “good health” for person wey don reach ninety-year dem no fit call am good health for person wey don reach twenty-year. D definition of long life dey different for now dan e be five hundred years before before.

Dis one no mean . however, say d concept of “health” dey entirely relative and subjective. A ten-year-old wey leukamia wan peme am dey unhealthy if we look am for any definition - just as twenty-year-old wey dey run marathon dey healthy if we look am for any definition. for now, a man wey tey for life for ninety years get long life if we look am statistically, though dat one fit change if medical technology just suddenly dey allow us tey reach two hundred for life.

As our definition of “health” dey wide, e no cancel d former definitions dem, but e just dey extend am. Id medical technology increase make ninety-year-olds dey win marathons dem, den our definition wetin be healthy for dose wey don old go change - but e no mean say d twenty-year-old person wey dey run marathon go suddenly com be unhealthy. to dey learn algebra no dey cancel arithmetic.

Truth self dey ogbonge wey dey relative to necessity as well. Newtonian physics don dey supplanted by Einsteinian physics, wey don prove say e dey accurate for tyt situations lyk extraordinarily high gravity or speed. However, dem sailors wey dey wish to calculate d correct way across an ocean go see say Newtonian physics na im dey accurate pass, but e dey ok for ship wey wan go New York from Lisbon. D labour wey dey involve to dey learn and implement Eisteinian physics na a net negative for sailor.

As a result, d sentence “Newtonian physics no too dey accurate dan Eisteinian physics, but Newtonian physics na d beta way to calculate a ship's way” we fit call am ogbonge proposition. Newtonian physics com be *less accurate*, and *more appropriate*.

If we wan drink water wey dey pure pass, we go lyk pay thousands of dollars dem for one bottle. Unless say we get ego wella and too dey frivolous, we neva fit pay dat ego say make we just drink water. Na true say water wey pure beta for us, but d price wey da purity nid don reach threshold of diminishing return dem. So “purer dey beta, na im dey reach “purer na im worse.”

Again, dis no mean say purity of water dey utterly subjective. Water wey dem distill dey potable pass seawater.

#### Truth And Objective Reality dem

D concept of *truth* dey necessarily involve d concept of *accuracy*. If I dey try shoot an arrow pass bull's eye, d accuracy of ma shot dey ontop how my arrow com land form d centre so.

Wetin, den, be d “bull’s-eye” of truth?

Well, d *truth* of a talk dey measurable relative to how e go in line wit objective reality.

Make we put dem language challenges for one corner now, if I point to one seagull and talk say, “Dat na anvil,” I dey clearly mistaken because say anvils na inorganic, and no fit fly. D truth value of ma statement dey measured relative to dem objective facts of reality. Since wey be say Seagull no be anvil, den ma statement no true.

Naturally, dis equation between truth and reality nid say make our language and sense make dem call am relatively objective. Plenty good reasons dey to believe say both language and sense evidence dey objective; we fit enta discussion wey dey complicated ontop dis, but make e suffice to talk say since na ur eyes u dey use read book wey dem write for man pikin language, we fit agree say ur eyes, and d language we share, na d least objective wey dey enough for u make u accurately process wetin I dey write. If dem no be, we no get anytin to yarn, and u neva sabi anytin wey I don write, so dis sentence no go get meaning be dat, and dem fit com render am for “Wingdings”.

Make we assume say u fi tell d difference between d two fonts wey dey above so, we fit reasonably continue.

#### Dem Accuracy And Consistency

E no dey possible for me make I paint a cloud accurately, since for d tym wey i go use paint am, d cloud go dey change evry evry. I fit paint a *photograph* pf a cloud, wey dem don freeze in tym.

If I use one hour say I be wan paint a cloud, and den I com ask u say shey ma painting na accurate representation of dat cloud so, u must necessarily reply say no be am.

For dem oda words, wen consistency no dey, accuracy no fit dey.

Wen we dream for nyt, our perceptions be say d rules of “matter” and “energy” dey for constant state of flux - we dey immune to gravity, and den we com dey fly wen we dey elephant back, and say we dey walk through wallas. E no dey possible say make we develop a “scientific physics of dreams” dan e dey to be accurate say make we paint a cloud.

Logic, science and truth, den, no dey possible wen *consistency* no dey.

Fundamentally, the laws of logic are derived from the behaviour of matter and energy, at least at the perceptual level. If I tell you to throw a ball both up and down at the same time, I am asking for the impossible, which you can easily test by attempting to fulfil my request. If I tell you to plough both the north field and the south field simultaneously, you will be unable to comply. If I demand that you turn a rose into a donkey, my demand will never be met.

Perceptual reality is consistent and objective – and it is from this consistency and objectivity that we derive the laws of logic. Our statements about reality can only accurately *represent* reality as a direct result of this consistency and objectivity.

The fact that seagulls do not arbitrarily turn into anvils – or vice versa – is the root of our capacity to accurately judge the statement: “That is a seagull.” If seagulls spontaneously and continually changed their nature, we would be unable to make either true or false statements regarding them – or anything for that matter.

This is the root of a key criterion of the scientific method – reproducibility. If I make a universal claim about the nature of gravity, then you should be able to reproduce that claim in your own environment. If reality were *not* consistent, then reproducibility would be an irrational criterion for the establishment of truth.

If you were a maths teacher, you would be very unlikely to accept a wrong answer from a student, even if that student claimed that his answer was “right” when he wrote it down, but just somehow changed in the interim.

Thus we can accept that we must measure the validity of a statement relative to objective reality – both empirically, and logically. Logic as a discipline arises only as a result of the consistency of reality; empirical observations are also valid or invalid only as a result of the consistent nature of reality.

### The Existence Of "Truth"

Truth, then, can be measured according to two central criteria:

1. Truth is a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the consistency of rationality, which is directly derived from the consistent behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^2]
2. Truth is also a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the nature and behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^3]

The first criterion is a measure of the consistency of ideas with themselves – and such consistency is a requirement because reality is consistent with itself. If I say, “I do not exist,” that is an example of an idea that is inconsistent with itself, since I must exist in order to utter the sentence. The second criterion is a measure of the accuracy of ideas relative to empirical observations of objective reality.

#### Empiricism Versus Rationality

Empiricism can be thought of as the ability to instinctively catch a thrown ball, or measure its movement; rationality is the ability to predict and understand the path that ball will take based on universal principles. Clearly, if balls randomly went in any and every direction – and magically transformed into flocks of doves to boot – we would be utterly unable to predict their behaviour.

Thus, since matter obeys immutable laws, our theories *about* matter must also obey immutable laws. If I know nothing about baseball, but watch a baseball game where the players always obey the rules, it would be irrational for me to formulate a theory about the rules of baseball that directly contradicted the behaviour of the players I was watching. Since the actions of the players are consistent, *any theory I develop regarding the rules that guide those actions must also be consistent*.

This requirement for consistency is one of the most basic requirements for truth. Since reality is consistent, theories regarding reality must also be consistent.

In fact, the first hurdle that any theory must overcome is that of *internal consistency*.

[^1]: If you do not value truth, you would never be in this debate – or any other debate – in the first place!

[^2]: Rational consistency, or internal logic.

[^3]: Empirical evidence, or empiricism.
