## Framework for ethics dem

Ethical propositions dey different from dem oda types of knowledge statements. If i talk say, “I like jazz,” dat one fit be true talk or make im be lie, but e no dey binding to u for any way. Ma own like for jazz na just talk of wetin I gbafun; based on my talk so, e no dey incumbent ontop u say make u like jazz or make u no like am.

Similarly, if i talk say “I like vegetables,” dat one too na just ma talk of wetin I like. However, if I talk say, “vegetables na healthy food,” den I don comot from ma own talk com enta talk wey be objective fact. E dey different from “I like ice cream,” and, “Ice cream get milk inside.”  

D fundamental difference wey dey between d talk *preference* and talk *fact* na say talk of facts dey objective, testable - and dey binding. If u value truth so, e dey incumbent ontop u make u agree say ice cream get milk inside, once wey dem don prove am.[^1]

If I say that the earth is round, and I provide ample proof for this statement, it is no longer up to you to determine on your own whim whether the statement is true. If I can prove that the earth is round, then you are bound to accept it as true, unless you are willing to reject reason and evidence as the criteria for truth.

If I accept the validity of mathematical laws, I cannot arbitrarily reject a mathematical proof that conforms to those laws. If I *do* reject such a proof, I can no longer claim to accept the validity of mathematical laws. My acceptance of these laws means that I am *bound* to accept as valid those proofs that conform to these laws. The rejection of a proof that conforms to rational standards is a rejection of rational standards as a whole.

The scientific method, rationality itself, and mathematical laws are all examples of *objective* criteria for establishing the truth of a proposition. It is not my opinion that two and two make four – if you also accept that two and two make four, you are not subjecting yourself to my mere opinion, but to a rational truth.

### Objective Truth

A central challenge in understanding the nature of truth is the realisation that “truth” does not exist in the world in the same way that a rock or tree does.

The concept “truth” is necessarily a relative term – though that does not mean a subjective or arbitrary term. The concept “health” is also a relative term – we compare “health” to sickness, and also to relative standards of health. What is considered “good health” for a ninety-year-old would scarcely be considered good health for a twenty-year-old. The definition of a long life is very different now than it was five hundred years ago.

This does not mean, however, that the concept of “health” is entirely relative and subjective. A ten-year-old dying of leukaemia is unhealthy by any definition – just as a twenty-year-old marathon runner is healthy by any definition. Currently, a man who lives to ninety has statistically had a long life, though that would change if medical technology suddenly allowed us to live to be two hundred.

As our definition of “health” expands, it does not invalidate earlier definitions, but rather extends them. If medical technology advances to allow ninety-year-olds to win marathons, then our definition of what is healthy for the aged will change – but that does not mean that the twenty-year-old marathon runner suddenly becomes unhealthy. Learning algebra does not invalidate arithmetic.

Truth also has value relative to necessity as well. Newtonian physics has been supplanted by Einsteinian physics, which has proven far more accurate in extreme situations such as extraordinarily high gravity or speed. However, sailors wishing to calculate the correct path across an ocean find Newtonian physics more than accurate enough. You wouldn’t want to send a spaceship to Alpha Centauri using Newtonian physics, but it is totally fine for getting a ship from Lisbon to New York. The labour involved in learning and implementing Einsteinian physics is thus a net negative for a sailor.

As a result, the sentence “Newtonian physics is less accurate than Einsteinian physics, but Newtonian physics is the best way to calculate a ship’s path” can be considered a valid proposition. Newtonian physics is thus both *less accurate*, and *more appropriate*.

If we wanted to drink the purest possible water, we would likely pay thousands of dollars per bottle. Unless we were enormously rich and highly frivolous, we would never pay that much to quench our thirst. It is true that pure water is better for us, but the price that purity requires hits a threshold of diminishing returns. Thus “purer is better” gives way to “purer is worse.”

Again, this does not mean that the purity of water is utterly subjective. Distilled water is always more potable than seawater.

#### Truth And Objective Reality

The concept of *truth* necessarily involves the concept of *accuracy*. If I am trying to shoot an arrow at a bull’s-eye, the accuracy of my shot is determined by how far my arrow lands from the centre.

What, then, is the “bull’s-eye” of truth?

Well, the *truth* of a statement is measurable relative to its conformity with objective reality.

Putting aside the challenges of language for the moment, if I point to a seagull and say, “That is an anvil,” I am clearly mistaken, because anvils are inorganic, and cannot fly. The truth value of my statement is measured relative to the objective facts of reality. Since the seagull is not in fact an anvil, my statement is untrue.

Naturally, this equation between truth and reality requires that language and our senses be considered relatively objective. There are many good reasons to believe that both language and sense evidence are in fact objective; we could get into a complicated discussion about this, but it should suffice to say that since you are using your eyes to read a book written in a human language, we can at least agree that your eyes, and the language we share, are at least objective enough for you to accurately process what I am writing. If they are not, we have nothing to talk about, and you haven’t understood anything I’ve written anyway, so this sentence will be equally meaningless, and might as well have been rendered in “Wingdings”.

Assuming you can tell the difference between the above two fonts, we can reasonably continue.

#### Accuracy And Consistency

It is impossible for me to accurately paint a cloud, since in the time it takes to paint it, the cloud continually changes. I can accurately paint a *photograph* of a cloud, which has become frozen in time.

If I spend an hour trying to paint a cloud, and then I ask you whether or not my painting is an accurate representation of that cloud, you must necessarily reply that it is not.

In other words, where there is no consistency, there can be no accuracy.

When we dream at night, our perceptions are that the rules of “matter” and “energy” are in a constant state of flux – we are immune to gravity, and then we fly on the back of an elephant, and then we can walk through walls. It is no more possible to develop a “scientific physics of dreams” than it is to accurately paint a cloud.

Logic, science and truth, then, are impossible in the absence of *consistency*.

Fundamentally, d laws of logic na im dey derive from d matter and energy behaviour, at least for d perceptual level. If I tell u say make u throw a ball both up and down for d same tym, Na somtin wey no dey possible I dey ask, wey u git test as u wan talk say make u do wetin I ask for. If I tell u say make u plough both d north field and d south field for d same tym, you no go fit do am. If I deman say make u turn rose into a donkey, u no fit meet ma demand.

Perceptual reality dey consistent and objective - and e no dey from dis consistency and objectivity wey we derive from dem logic laws. Our statement about reality fit only accurately *represent* reality wey be direct result of dis consistency and objectivity so.

D fact say seagulls no arbitrarily turn enta anvils - or vice versa - na d root of our capacity to judge d talk accurately: “Dat one na seagull.” If seagulls dey change dia nature spontaneously and continually, we no go fit make maybe na tru or false talk ontop dem - or anytin for dat matter.

Dis na d root of a key criterion of d scientific method - reproducibility. If I make a universal claim say about d nature og gravity, den you suppose fit reproduce dat claim for ur own environment. If reality *no* dey consistent, den reproducibiliyu go be irrational criterion for truth wey dem wan establish.

If u be maths teacher, you no go wan accept answer wey wrong from a student, even make dat student talk say im answer dey “right” wen e put am down, but e be like say e change for d interim.

Thus we fit accept say we fit measure d vaidity of a talk relative to objective reality  both empirically, and logically. Logic as discipline dey arise as a result of d consistency of reality dem; empirical observations na ogbonge or no be ogbonge as a result of d reality nature wey dey consistence.

### D existence of "Truth"

Truth, den, fit dey measured acoording to two central criteria:

1. Truth na measure of correlation wey dey between d ideas for our minds and d consistency of rationality dem, wey be say dem derive am straight from d consistent behaviour of matter and energy wey dey d real world.[^2]
2. Truth na also measure of d correlation wey dey between d ideas for our minds and d nature and behaviour of matter and energy for d real world.[^3]

D first criterion na measure of d consistency of idease wit demself - and dat kyn consistency na requirement because say reality dey consistent im self. If I talk say, “I no dey exist,” dat one na exaple of idea wey no dey consistent im self, since I must dey exist before I talk dat kyn tin. D second criterion na measure of d accuracy of ideas wey dey relative to empirical observtions of reality wey dey objective.

#### Empiricism Versus rationality dem

We fit tink empiricism say na ability to catch a ball wey dem throw instinctively, or to measure im movement; rationality na d ability to predict and sabi d path wey d ball go pass based ontop d universal principles. Clearly, if d ball randomly go any and evry direction - and com turn into flock of doves to boot magically - we we no go fit predict dia behaviour.

Thus, since matter com follow immutable laws, our theories *about* matter suppose follow immutable laws too. If I no sabi anytin for baseball, but I dey watch baseball game wia dem players dey follow d rules, e no go dey normal say make I formulate theory about dem baseball rules wey no agree wit d behaviour of dem players wey I dey watch. Since d actions of dem players dey consistent, *any theory wey I develop ontop d rules wey dey guide dose actions suppose dey consistent too.

Dis requirement for consistency na one of dem most basic requirements for truth dem. Since reality dey consistent, theories ontop reality suppose dey consistent too.

In fact, d first hurdle wey any theory suppose overcome na dat one of *internal consistency*.

[^1]: If u no value truth, u no go neva dey dis debate - or any oda debate - for d first place!

[^2]: Normal consistency, or logic wey dey internal.

[^3]: Empirical evidence, or empiricism.
