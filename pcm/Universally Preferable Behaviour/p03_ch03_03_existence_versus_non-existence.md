### Governments And Religion

De idea say dem born you kon create one contract with one agency wey nor dey exist, which for real ground you resemble slave to some kind people, dey common to both religion and de state – and another one, far more agency wey be person own, which I don first talk about for my first book “On Truth: The Tyranny Of Illusion.”

Whenever one priest talk say: “Obey God,” wetin im dey really talk na: “Obey me.” Since God nor dey exist, any commandment wey de priest claim say e dey come from God, dey actually come from de priest. “God” na just wetin nor real wey dem dey use take bully you in order for dem to get your service for low level for real world, to real people, in terms of you dey hand money come out voluntarily, time and resources.

E dey far more efficient for those wey dey exploit people to get their slaves look am say slavery na power, since e cut down well well on de cost to control dem. If I fit convince you say e dey evil to avoid make you serve me, and say na power to be my slave, then, I nor need to hire many agberos to bully, control and steal from you.

Religious and state mythologies, dat time, na wetin nor real wey reduce de cost to control population well well; na dem be de oil and fuel for de deadly planning of violence wey dem arrange.

Throughout de world, rulers na very small percentage of de population. How e go fit dey possible for one or two percent of people to control everybody else? E get one certain monopoly on military weapons, to dey sure, but  monopoly dey easy to counter, since most governments dey make fortune when dem sell weapons throughout de world.

De sad reality na dat people as a whole dey  enslaved to things wey nor real like nation, gods, cultures – and governments.

Our personal pride dey use style rebel against us one quick slavery wey dem force for person to another human being – anyhow  as e be, we be like to almost dey enjoy in slavery to mythology.

Our desire to dey good – join with de thrill of power wey we dey get by to dey obey mythologies wey good – make us dey line up to willingly hand over our things to those wey dey claim to represent those mythologies.

One central reason wey we know say government and gods nor dey necessary na that dem dey effective. *We know say most people desperately wan dey good because dem dey easily controlled by theories wey good.

De logic of obedience to mythology dey clearly foolish. If one priest tell me say I need to obey “God,” dis na exactly de same as him dey tell me say I must obey wetin nor real wey dem dey call”Nog.” Even if I accept say dis thing wey nor real dey worthy to obey  forever, dis one nor go still push me to obey de priest in any way. If I tell you to “obey your heart,” I fit use reason talk say: “and *me alone* talk for your heart”?

Of course no.

When we strip comot mythology and wetin nor real for our “conversation” with our rulers, wetin go come na reality wey dey fierce, empty and e fit kill.

Make we by take as example one very real and present danger: taxation

#### Taxation

Dem tell me say, by say I choose to live for Canada, I owe “de government” more than fifty percent of my income.

Comot mythology, wetin dis thing really translate to?

For reality, I go wait until de end of time for “de government” to come and kon pick up their money. To dey wait for “de government” to drop by be like we wan date de idea of “femininity.” I fit as well try to pay for my dinner with de word “money.”

For reality, when dem tell me say I must pay my tax t “de government,” wetin e actually mean na say I must write check to transfer my money into one particular bank account, which some people go kon check. Dis people kon get de right to take de money, and spend am as dem fit – dis particular people get complete control over my money.

E nor get any point at all wey something like “de government” lift one finger, kon move, open one bank account, or spend one penny. Imagine say wetin nor real wey  dem dey call “de government” get de capacity to take or spend your money na exactly de same thing as you go wait for “God” to come kon pick you up take you go church.

So, de real conversation na one guy send me one letter dey tell me say I owe am money. I nor get contract with dis guy, and e nor own any of my property, although some other guys write one supposed “contract” wey claim say he own my property.

If I nor pay dis guy, he go send another guy come my house to kon collect de money – plus “interest” and “charges.” 

Normally, when one man with gun come my house and demand for my money, I get right to use force take defend myself. For dis case, anyhow as e be, because im dey costume and kon claim to represent something wey nor real, I nor dey allowed to use force defend myself.

Now, if I come to your house tonight and I dress as one “high elf of Narnia” and demand de money wey you dey owe de”Queen of Sorrows,” assuming say nor be Halloween, you dey allowed to dey look me with amazement, and order me to comot from your property.

If I nor pay de man who come kon take my money, he dey allowed to pull gun come out, point am for my chest, and kidnap me – or shoot me if I resist. He go fit hold me for one tiny cell year after year, where I go face de most painful brutality and constant rape, until he go choose to let me go.

As e dey interesting, if one man owe me money legally, I nor dey allowed to kidnap am and make am to face torture and rape am year after year. So, taxation totally violate de UPB framework, since na de violent transfer of property wey dem dey use force.

Stealing, as we don prove, na evil.

Einstein completely change physics by to dey claim – and prove – say de speed of light dey constant.

We go fit change de world completely by to accept de claim – and de proof – say stealing na always evil.

### Government, Religion, And UPB

When we take de UPB framework and kon apply am to correct good behaviour wey relate regarding government and religion, some result wey dey interesting go occur.

The proposition that is most often used to justify government power is: “the government has the right to take your money.” This, however, is an utterly imprecise and false statement. The “government” does not have the right to take your money, since “the government” is merely a concept, an abstract description for a self-defined group of people. UPB requires a more consistent and objective statement. Since moral rules must be the same for everyone in all places and at all times, we must rephrase the rule in this way:

“*Human beings can morally take money from other human beings if they make up a conceptual agency that justifies their actions.*”

If we return to Bob and Doug in our little room of moral experimentation, we can very quickly see that this becomes an impossible proposition.

If Bob says to Doug: “I now represent the ideal concept ‘FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me taking your lighter from you. Since you now owe me your lighter, you must hand it over, or I will be compelled to take it from you by force.”

What will Doug’s reaction be? Remember, according to UPB, whatever is valid for Bob must also be valid for Doug. Inevitably, Doug will reply: “Oh yeah? Well *I* now represent the ideal concept ‘ANTI-FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me retaining possession of my lighter. Since you now have no right to take my lighter, if you try to take it, I will be compelled to defend myself by force.”

As you can see, if *Bob* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Doug, then *Doug* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Bob. Clearly, we immediately end up in a perfect stalemate. If it is morally good to impose made-up obligations on other people, but it is impossible to do it if *everyone* possesses that ability, then morality becomes impossible. The only way that Bob can impose his made-up obligation on Doug is if Doug refuses to impose his made up obligation on Bob – thus we have a situation where what is moral for one person can only be achieved by the other person acting in an anti-moral manner. Virtue can thus only be enabled by vice, which is impossible – and we have opposing moral rules for two human beings in the same circumstance, which UPB instantly rejects as invalid.

In other words, every imaginary abstract justification for the use of force can be countered by another imaginary abstract justification for the use of force. If I have an imaginary friend that can justify everything I do, then *you* also can have an imaginary friend that can justify everything you do. Thus neither of us can possess the ability to impose our imaginary obligations on others.

#### Religion And UPB

The same holds true for religion.

The statement: “You must obey me because God commands it,” must be restated more accurately as: “an entity that I have made up commands you to obey me.” The principle that UPB requires, then, is: “Human beings must impose unchosen positive obligations on others, and justify those obligations according to imaginary entities.”

Here we see the same issues as above. Bob tells Doug: “You must give me your lighter, because my imaginary friend tells you to.” Naturally, Doug replies: “You must not ask me for your lighter, because *my* imaginary friend forbids you to.” If Bob’s “commandments” are valid, then Doug’s “commandments” are equally valid, and so cancel each other out.

In the same way, if a man claims that his concept called “the government” justifies his theft of my property, then I can claim that my concept called “the anti-government” justifies my *retention* of my property, and we are both equally “valid” in our justifications.

If this tax collector then claims that his concept called “the government” only justifies his theft of *my* property, not my retention of it, then we are no further ahead. He can take my thousand dollars, but then I can invoke my concept to “steal” that money back, and his moral theory commands us to spend the rest of eternity handing back and forth the thousand dollars.

#### UPB And "The Majority"

UPB does not allow for the accumulation of individuals to override or reverse the properties of each individual. Ten lions do not make an elephant, a government, or a god. Ten thousand soldiers might make an “army,” but they cannot reverse gravity, or make murder moral.

Returning one last time to the room of Bob and Doug, let’s introduce “Jane.”

Now that there are three people in the room, we can look at the “majority rule” principle.

If Bob, Doug and Jane take a “vote” on whether or not it is moral to rape Jane, we would all recoil at such an unjust and immoral premise. Clearly, even if Jane were “outvoted,” we would not consider the resulting rape to be transformed into a morally good act.

Why not?

Well, UPB does not recognise the reality of aggregations, since the “majority” is a mere conceptual tag; it does not exist in reality, any more than “gods” or “governments” do. Thus to claim that the concept of “the majority” has any sort of moral standing is utterly invalid – it is like saying that “the Fatherland” can impregnate a woman, or that one can sit in the word “chair.”

To say that “the majority” has rights or attributes which directly contradict the rights or attributes of any individual also contradicts rational principles, since any conceptual grouping is only validated by the accurate identification of individual characteristics. If I say that “mammals” are warm-blooded living creatures, can I logically include three plastic flamingos in the category “mammal”?

Of course not.

Thus if it is evil for human beings to rape, can I logically create a category called “the majority” and then claim that for *these* human beings, rape is now morally good?

Of *course* not.

### Majority Rule

Can I create a moral rule that says: “the majority should be able to do whatever it wants”?

Of course I can, but it will never be valid or true.

Only *individuals* act – the “majority” never does. If moral rules can change when a certain number of people get together, then UPB is continually violated.

If it is moral for Bob and Doug to rape Jane because they have “outvoted her,” what happens when Jane’s two friends show up and vote against Bob and Doug’s infernal desires?

Well, suddenly Bob and Doug are the ones outvoted, and rape becomes “evil” for them again.

Nothing substantial has changed in these “outvoting” scenarios, but we have a series of opposing moral rules for the same men – a violation of UPB, and thus invalid.

Rape cannot be good, then evil, then good again, just because a few hands are raised or lowered.

Thus if you think that “majority rule” sounds like a reasonable moral proposition, and a perfectly valid moral theory, then I am afraid you’re going to have to go back to the beginning of this book and start again!☺
