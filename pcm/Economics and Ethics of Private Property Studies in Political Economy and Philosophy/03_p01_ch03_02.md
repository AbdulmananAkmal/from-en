### De State and De Monopolization of Money and Banking

De economic order wey dey now get characteristic of national money dem instead of one universal money, of fiat money instead of commodity like gold, of monopolistic central banking instead of free banking; and of  bank fraud wey dey permanent, and steady income and wealth redistribution, inflation wey dey permanent and business cycle wey dey happen again and again as im economic counterpart dem, instead of 100-percent-reserve banking wey no one of dis consequences go show.

For big time contradiction, den, for no man sef-interest to use economic integration maximize im wealth, different anti-economic interest wey dey win economic interest must to dey responsible for de emergence of de monetary order dem we dey now.

Person fit get and increase wealth by homesteading, to produce and by, or contractual exchange, or to collecf homesteaders, producers or contractual exchangers dia property by force. E no get anoda way. De two ways dey natural to man pikin. togeda with some interest inside producing and contracting, interest to get nonproductive and contractual property and wealth don always dey. And for inside de course of exonomic development, de same way wey de former interest fit lead to de formation of productive enterpise firm dem plus including corporations, na so de latter one go fit lead to largescale enterprse dem, come bring government dem or states to standa.[^9]

De size and growth of a productive enterprise dey constrained for one hand by voluntary consumer demand, and for de oda hand by de competition of oda producers dat continuously forces each firm to dey operate with de lowest possible costs if e wishes to stay for business. For dat kind enterprise to grow in size, de most urgent consumer wants must be served first in de most efficient ways. Nothing but voluntary consumer purchases support its size.

The constraints on de oda type of institution—de state—are altogether different.[^10] For one thing, e dey obviously absurd to talk say e own emergence and growth dey determined by demand for de same sense as an economic firm. Person nor fit talk say by any stretch of de imagination say de homesteaders, de producers and de contractual exchangers who go must surrender (part of) dia assets to a state don eva demand dat kind service. Instead, dem dey force dem to go accept am, and dis na conclusive proof of de fact say de service nor even dey in demand at all. For de oda hand, de state dey also nor constrained for same way by competition like a productive firm. For unlike such a firm, de state nor go keep e own costs of operation for a minimum, but fit operate at above-minimum costs, becos e dey able to shift e higher costs ontop e competitors by taxing or regulating dia behavior. As far say de state don come out, den, e dey do so in spite of de fact say e nor even dey in demand or dey efficient.

Instead of make dem use cost and demand conditions, de way wey exploiting furm dey grow, na public opinion dey constrain am: E require force to get nonproductive and noncontractual property, and victim go always dey wen dem use force. E dey noticeable say for dey break resistance wen e concern one man (or one group of me) wey dey exploit one or maybe two or three oda men (or one group wey be almost de same size). E dey noticeable, howeva,  to imagine say force alone fit account for de break down of resistance for case wey det familiar, of small minority dem wey dey use force collect things wey  ten, hundred or thousand of dia size. for dis one to happen one firm must to get public support add to coercive force. majority of de people must accept sey im operation legit. Dis acceptance must to range from active enthusiasm to passive resignation. Howeva, acceptance e must  happen say majority must to don give up de idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt get nonproductive and noncontractual property by force. Instead of to display vex for dat kind action, of to show contempt for every person wey follow inside, and of to do anytin wey go help dem dey successful (make we nor mention, to try to obstruct dem), one majority must support dem actively or passively. de opinion of public wey dey support state must to counterbalance de resistance of property owner dem wey fall victim so dat active resistance go appear as wetin nor dey important. And goal wey de state get and  de goal of de people wey de state employ wey want to contribute to secure and improve dia own position inside  de state, must be de one wey dey maximize wealth incom wey dem use force get, by to produce public opinion and to create legitimacy wey dey favourable.

Na only two complementary measure wey dey available for de state wey dey try to accomplish dis one. For one hand, na Ideological propaganda wey dey. na much time and effort wey dem dey spend to convince de public sey things no dey as we see am: Exploitation na freedom true true, taxes na by choice: noncontractual relations na really “conceptually” contractual ones dem be; [^11] No body dey rule anybody, na we de rule we sef; without de state law or security nor go dey; and poor people go perish and so on.

For de oda hand, redistribution dey. Instead of make people be ordinary parasite consumer of good dem wey oda people don make, de state dey redistribute some of im coercively appropriated wealth give people wey nor follow for de state apparatus and dat way e dey try to corrupt dis people to assume some roles wey dey support de state.

But nor be any kind redistribution go dey ok. Just as idea dem must to serve —statist—purpose, so na redistribution must do. Redistribution nid cost-expenditure and so e need justification. E nor dey undertaken by de state just to do wetin nice for some peoole, just as, wen person give anoda person gift. or weda dem do am just to gain high income  from exchange dem, just as wen ordinary  economic business carry body enter trade. dem do am to make sure say dem fit continue to use force collect property. Redistribution must to serve dis strategic purpose. Im cost dem must to dey justified for de terma of increase state income and wealth. De political entrepreneurs dem wey dey in charge of de state apoaratus go fit do mistake for dis task, just like ordinary businessmen, cos dem must make dia decision on top which redistributive measure go serve dis purpose wella as dem dey expect dia result.  And if entrepreneurial mistake happen, de state income fit to fall instead of to rise, e fit even spoil im own exstence. Na de very work of state politics and de work of political entrepreneurship to avoid situation dem like dat and to choose policy wey go increase state income.

While we nor go fit predict de particular form of redistributive policy dem or dia particular outcome dem, but instead dem fit change with changing circumstances, de natur of de state go still require say im redistributive policy must follow one particular order and e go display one type of structural regularity. [^12]

As one firm carry body join for de maximisation  of exploitatively appropriated wealth, de first place wey  de state go apply redistributiv measures na production of securiry, as in, of police, defense and judicial system. De state go dey depend on force and so e nor go fit do without armes forces. Any armed forces wey dey compete—wey go naturally come out for de market so dat e go fit satisfy genuine demand for security and protection service dem— na threat to im  existence and dem must eliminate am sharp-sharp. To do dis one na to claim de job for im sef, come become de only supplier and redestributor of protection service dem for one define territory. Na de same way wey, judicial system wey dey compete go tanda as immediate threat to one state as e claim say im dey legit. And again, for de sake of im own existence de judicial system must to dey monopolized and dem must carry legal services join im body for dem redistributive scheme.

The state’s nature as an institution engaged in organized aggression also explains the importance of the next field of redistributive activities: that of traffic and communication. There can be no regular exploitation without monopolistic control of rivers, coasts, seaways, streets, railroads, airports, mail, and telecommunication systems. Thus, these things, too, must become the object of redistribution.

Of similar importance is the field of education. Depending as it does on public opinion and its acceptance of the state’s actions as legitimate, it is essential for a state that unfavorable ideological competition be eliminated as far as possible and statist ideologies spread. The state attempts to accomplish this by providing educational services on a redistributive basis.

Furthered by a system of state education, the next crucial area for redistribution is that of redistributing state power itself, i.e., the right assumed by the state to expropriate, exploit and redistribute nonproductively appropriated assets. Instead of remaining an institution which restricts entry into itself and/or particular government positions, a state increasingly, and for obvious strategic reasons, adopts an organizational structure which in principle opens up every position to everyone and grants equal and universal rights of participation and competition in the determination of state policy. Everyone—not just a privileged nobility—receives a legal stake in the state in order to reduce the resistance to state power.[^13]

With the monopolization of law and security production, traffic, communication and education, as well as the democratization of state rule itself, all features of the modern state have been identified but one: the state’s monopolization of money and banking. For all but this one it has been explained, albeit briefly, how they can and must be understood as performing strategic functions: why and how they are not normal productive contributions determined by demand and supply forces or simply good deeds, but redistributive activities which serve the purpose of stabilizing and, if possible, increasing a state’s exploitatively appropriated income and wealth.

The monopolization of money and banking is the ultimate pillar on which the modern state rests. In fact, it has probably become the most cherished instrument for increasing state income. For nowhere else can the state make the connection between redistribution-expenditure and exploitation-return more directly, quickly and securely than by monopolizing money and banking. And nowhere else are the state’s schemes less clearly understood than here.

Preferring, like everyone, a higher to a lower income, yet unlike others, being in the business of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions, the state’s position regarding money and banking is obvious: Its objectives are served best by a pure fiat money monopolistically controlled by the state. For only then are all barriers to counterfeiting removed (short of an entire breakdown of the monetary system through hyperinflation) and the state can increase its own income and wealth at another’s expense practically without cost and without having to fear bankruptcy.[^14]

However, there are obstacles in the way of attaining this enviable state of affairs. On one hand, there is the inexorable fact that money can emerge only as a commodity. (It is impossible to start out with fiat money).[^15] On the other hand, there is the problem that while enrichment through counterfeiting is no doubt less conspicuous than doing so by means of taxation, it is nonetheless a measure that is bound to be noticed, certainly by the banks, particularly if it occurs on a regular basis. And so it is also impossible for the state to get away with institutionalized counterfeiting unless it can be combined with redistributive measures which are capable of bringing about another favorable change in public opinion. This problem and the state’s natural desire essentially determine the course of its actions.

As the result of free market processes, the state finds gold established as money and a system of free banking. Its goal is the destruction of this system and with it the removal of all obstacles to counterfeiting. Technically (ignoring for the moment all psychological difficulties involved in this), the sequence of steps that must be taken in order to accomplish this objective is then dictated: In a first step the minting of gold must be monopolized by the state. This serves the purpose of psychologically denationalizing gold by shifting the emphasis from gold as denominated in universal terms of weight to gold as denominated in terms of fiat labels. And it removes a first important obstacle toward counterfeiting because it gives the state the very institutional means of enriching itself through a systematic process of currency debasement.

[^9]: Contrary to the claim of the public choice school, states and private firms are not doing essentially the same sort of business, but instead are engaged in categorically different types of operations. Both types of institutions are the outcome of different, antagonistic interests. The “political” interest in exploitation and expropriation underlying the formation of states obviously requires and presupposes the existence of wealth, and hence an “economic” interest of at least one person in producing such wealth in the first place (while the reverse is not true). But at the same time, the more pronounced and successful political interests are, the more destructive of economic interests this will be. The public choice school is perfectly correct in pointing out that everyone—a government employee no less than an employee of an economic firm—normally prefers a higher to a lower income and that this interest explains why government should be expected to have no less of a tendency to grow than any other enterprise.

::::However, this discovery—that politicians and bureaucrats are no more altruistic or concerned about the public good than are people in other walks of life—is hardly new even if it has sometimes been overlooked. Yet what is in fact new with public choice is the inference drawn from this correct insight then, that all institutions should hence be regarded as an outgrowth of identical motivational forces and be treated analytically on a par with each other—is false to the point of being ridiculous. Regardless of a person’s subjective beliefs, integrating one’s actions into the institutional framework of either the state or a “normal” economic enterprise and pursuing one’s wealth maximizing interests here or there will in fact produce categorically different outcomes.
