##  Research wey base on top causal scientific principle fit dey possible for inside social science?

###

De use of mathematical and statistical  don dey spread inside social science . E don dey show some importance, derefore, to demonstrate with full description of all dis technique dem say reason dey to doubt dia applicability for de field of  social sciences.

De aim of dis paper na to offer de kind demonstration wey get specific reference to de techniques wey go allow us to take one set of data come decide de value of de constant dem, by de means wey one variable, wey dem interprete as dependent variable, fit carry body join law-governed relationship  with oda variable dem. E nor dey relevant weda dis relationship dey linear or nonlinear, weda na one or more  independent variable dem wey dey, weda—as e be for time-series analyses— de dependent variable dem dey also function (time-shifted) as independent variable dem, and weda de relationship dey recursive or nonrecursive, deterministic or statiscal. De  critique dey apply to all technique, from simple linear regression to de comparatively complex procedure of time-series analysis, as far as dat kind technique na im dem dey use to decide de value of constants (including dose wey get value wey vary according to same consistent pattern). E nor too need pointing out say de use of dat kind technique don dey increase. For de field of economics,  econometrics dey steadily establish im position as de house of all dis technique, [^1] even top de criticism from people wey support pure economics. [^2] For sociology, too, de systematic introduction of econometric technique dem don dey show as universal panacea, as dem Forster one trend pass odas cos of de works of Blalock.[^3]

To illustrate all dis argument, make we assume say de value of de constants ::b_1:: and ::b_2:: in the multiple regression equation

::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e:: 

don dey determined on top de basis of one particular set of data. ::Y::—we dey interprete de dependent variable— as  linear function of de independent variables ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: and a magnitude of error e with a mean value of ::0::.

Na in two ways we go fit interprete de :b:-constants for dis equation. either na innocuous, but unusual interpretation or dia normal interpretation. Dis second interpretation sha, no dey innocuous. E carry assumption join body, wey as we go show, nor dey appropriate inside social science dem

Just as de first innocuous interpretation, de partial regression coefficients dey represent notin pass de variable statement of how to predict de ::Y:: values  well on de basis of de ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: values (assuming sey both linearity and dat one dey deal with additive effect dem). De constants na historico-mathematical facts. Dem no get any significance wey pass de historical data as e concern which value dem determine.

Objection nor fit dey for dis interpretation. de consequences dey sha, say to set up equation like de one wey dey up, dey downgrade im relevance. Nor be theoretical principle wey person go dey establish, instead im go just dey describe de fact dem and wetin be one of a kind description for imfit generate  at will for any group of data, by just to change im assumption about de type of function and by to use computer.

E nor dey probable say anybody don eva do regression analysis cos im wan achieve only wetin dis innocuous interpretation dey mean. Dem dey interpret am as to formulate general hypothesis, to set up de  equation wey dey up, wey we fit talk sey na false if we use new data and data wey dey claim say de relationship between  ::Y::, ::X_1:: and ::X_2::, wey de constant determine for de equation dey universally valid.

###

We fit reconstruct de implicit assumptions wey dis interpretation dey demand if we consider de following situation. wen we use fresh data we don make attempt to reproduce de result wey we get and wey we formalize through analysis of de initial set of data for de above equation, wen we use constants with determined value dem. Make we assume say de outcome of dus attempt na say de  multiple linear regression analysis wey we do for both de ::Y:: and the ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: variables of dis second group of data produces :b: constants wey diverge wella from dose wey we obtain for de first group of data.
As e be for de innocuous interpretation of dat kind equation, dis result nor go get any particular consequences. With de first set of data, person don establish one type of historico-mathematical fact and with de second one, na anoda fact. De two dey difderent, and na all about am be dat. Just as de normal interpretation, howeva de failure to reproe de result go make de hypothesis to be false.

De prerequisite to dey able to say na “falsify” be de “constancy principle,” de conviction say observable phenomena dey for principle wey cause determine,  wey sey constant  and wey also dey time-invariant for de way wey dem dey operate, and say for principle contingency nor get any part to play for de way wey cause dey operate. Na only we dem assume say de constancy principle dey valid wey im dey from any failure to make anoda result say anytin dey wrong with de original hypothesis.

E clear say de constancy principle nor  base on top experience. As we don know since Hume, e no get link wey we don see wey connect event dem, and even if dat kind link dey, experience nor dit show weda e been dey time-invariant or  not.Dem no fit disapprove de principle by experience, cos if dem don accept am, any oda event wey wan disprove am (like failure to duplicate result) fit dey interpreted from  de beginning as if experience dey show say one variable nor be de cos of anoda variable if dem dey explain (if nor be so, de result go dey duplicated successfully).  We nor fit draw any conclusion weda dem fit find anoda variable wey turn out to be time-invariant with de way wey e dey operate with respect to de dependent variable wey we dey interested in. To de extent wey experience nor fit exclude dis possibility, we nor fit disprove de validity of de constancy principle.

Although e nor dey derived from experience and e nor dey disprovable by experience, de constancy principle na very  necessary condition for experience  wey dem fit regard if dem dey  confirm abi falsifying demsef (wey dey in contrast to de isolated and unconnected  experiences wey dey connected with historical facts).[^4]  Dem fit interpret de failure to duplicate results could be interpreted as falsifying de original hypothesis wey dey in accordance with de normal interpretation of de regression equation, and person fit dey prompted make e explain de differing values for de :b: constants by asserting say for one sample one abi more factors ::F:: dey implicitly involved in causing ::Y:: wey nor dey present for de oda sample abi wey nor operate for de same way. Finally, person fit feel de need make e explain dese factors ::F:: hypothetically and make e put dem inside dey initial hypothesis wey only assume only de systematic operation of ::X_1:: and ::X_2::, so e go replace one hypothesis with new one. But all dis only dey possible to de extent say person don already assume de validity of de constancy principle for ::Y:: with all de factors wey dey ::Y::.

We don assert say sphere of objective reality dey wey  we nor fit regard  as determined laws, and say, derefor, nor equation dey describe em behaviour (just lik de regression equation wey dem give for u) wey dem fit formulate and wey dem fit give normal interpretation.

Since we nor fit doubt de validity of de constancy principle for de evidence of external, sensory experience, e dey on only logical ground say dem go correctly regard de principle as inapplicable for any particular sphere.

De constancy principle na operational  schema, na method. Person nor fit experience cum learn say causes dey wey dey always operate  for de same way, instead person go establish say dat phenomena get particular cause by following a particular type of investigative procedure, thru refusing principle wey go allow any exceptions (instances of inconstancy), and e go dey prepared say e go deal with dem by producing new hypothesis anytime wey dem need one. De world by itself nor dey sufficient to take establish de constancy principle. E require de existence of perceiving subject wey dey active. For em part, dis active subject - de prerequisite for a world wey causes wey get constant effect determine - nor fit, cos of logical reasons, assume de validity wey dey de constancy principle with respect to de states of em knowledge (and for em intentional actions wey fit draw on dat knowledge). In order say dem wan guarantee de unconditional validity of de constancy principle, de subject must fit learn by emsef. E must start from de assumption say e fit assimilate experiences wey dey falsified and e must fit replace old hypothesis with new ones dem. If on de oda hand person fit view em state of knowledge as e take cause am and if person go treat anytin wey dem neva know as being predictable for principle, person go deprive emsef of all possibilities wey em go fit use em ability take learn, as in, wey he go use form new, previously hypothesis wey dem neva know before, as de way wey dem fit use maintain de law-governed nature of dat sphere of reality, wey nor dey constituted by knowledge abi actions drawing for dat knowledge.

De result of dis logical analysis of de constancy principle as de principle of a nonempirically based operational schema wey under causal investigation  be say de principle only dey valid for dat objective sphere wey nor dey constituted with person knowledge abi actions wey dey manifest dat knowledge. (In dis sphere, de question of weda law-governed constants dey on de basis say e go dey possible  make dem make ex ante prediction  dey positively determined independently  of experience, and empirical factors fit only play role for de question  of which concrete variable  dey causally linked to which  concrete variable  and which one nor dey linked.) For de sphere of knowledge and action, for anoda hand, e nor fit dey valid. (for dis sphere, de question of weda or not constant dey even dey empirical for nature and dem only fit decide am for a given variable based on experience wey don pass, wey dey decided ex post.)

For anyone wey dey capable to learn, deir knowledge nor fit dey logically regarded as determined by complex causes wey dey operate for constant way (whether statistically abi deterministically). Dere fit be only constants wey dey in relation to de causes of event where person dey deal with a world of nonlearning objects, abi more correctly, where person conceive an objective sphere of reality as a world of nonlearning objects. Person nor fit to dey think of emsef as nonlearning. Nor be only as intellect wey dey function according with de constancy principle fit be learning intellect (we dey learn about how objects wey dem conceive as non-learning dey behave), but de statement “I fit learn” also prove to hold through for oda respects. Na fact say dem nor fit falsify am, cos if dem wan falsify am, person go need to learn. And from anoda side, person nor fit argue justifiably against de statement since, qua argument, possible replies must dey for am, and as de validity of argument (wey dem oppose to dat of a stimulus) go dey independent of de nature wey dem use reply, dem must regard dat kind possible reply as contingent reactions, and derefor, e must dey possible to learn am.

[^5]: The same illusion would also arise in relation to God, if one assumed that He too could learn.

[^6]: Karl R. Popper, *Das Elend des Historizismus* (Tübingen: Mohr, 1971), p. xii, states in this connection that it is

::::> impossible for any scientific forecaster—whether human being or computer—to predict his or her or us own future results, no matter what methods are used. Any attempt to do so can only achieve its goal post festum.

::::On the methodological significance of this statement see also K.O. Apel, *Die Erklären: Verstehen Kontroverse in transzendental-pragmatischer Sicht* (Frankfurt/ M.: Suhrkamp, 1979), note 19, pp. 44ff.

###

Let us return to the regression equation given at the beginning of the discussion:

::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e::

and bring the argument full circle. Let the dependent variable ::Y:: in this equation be any intentional action (an action which attempts by some means to achieve a goal preferred over a starting point and other alternatives, and which in various ways manifests knowledge).

By setting up this equation or by determining the values of the constants for a particular set of data, if we accept the normal interpretation, we are making the following assertion:

There exists a complex of causes operating in a constant fashion which causes ::Y::, and it is possible on the basis of our knowledge of this complex and of the way in which it operates (its function type) to predict the occurrence or nonoccurrence of the intentional act ::Y:: (conceived of as a dichotomic 0/1 variable). On the basis of experiences in connection with a particular set of data, the causal relationships explaining ::Y:: are described by a provisional hypothesis as in the above equation (with the values of the constants determined with respect to magnitude). New experiences may mean that these concrete assumptions about the causal variable and function types have to be revised. The equation may be replaced by others incorporating different assumptions. Some examples might be:

1. ::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_3 + e::
2. ::Y = a + b_1 Z + b_1 X_1 + e::
3. ::Y = a + b_1 \log X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e::
4. ::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_1 X_2 + e::


In equation ::(1):: it is assumed that ::X_3:: is a causal variable as well as ::X_2::. Equation ::(2):: assumes that a variable ::Z:: (correlated with ::X_1::) is the cause of ::Y:: and not ::X_1:: as originally assumed. Equation ::(3):: no longer assumes a linear relation in respect to the effect of ::X_1::. Lastly, equation ::(4):: assumes an interactive as well as an additive effect with regard to the two variables ::X_1:: and ::X_2::. No matter which equation is substituted for the original one, however, nor whether the original one is repeatedly found to be valid, it remains the case that ::Y:: can be predicted, however much one may argue about the precise details of the equation.

Our previous discussion demonstrated that this assertion is untenable. ::Y::, qua intentional act, cannot in principle be predicted. This conclusion follows from the argument which we may summarize here:

1. I and—as possible opponents in an argument—other people are able to learn.[^7] (This statement cannot be challenged without implicitly admitting that it is correct. Above all, it must be assumed by anyone undertaking research into causes. To this extent, proposition ::(1):: is valid a priori).
2. If it is possible to learn, one cannot know at any given time what one will know at any later time and how one will act on the basis of this knowledge. (If one did know at any given time what one will come to know at some later time, it would be impossible ever to learn anything—but see proposition ::(1):: on this point.)
3. The assertion that it is possible to predict the future state of one’s own and/or another’s knowledge and the corresponding actions manifesting that knowledge (i.e., to find the variables which can be interpreted as the causes) involves a contradiction. If the subject of a given state of knowledge or of an intentional act can learn, then there are no causes for this; however, if there are causes, then the subject cannot learn—but again see proposition ::(1)::.

[^7]: The transition from one person to the other presupposes the indefensibility of solipsism. There can be no disputing that it is possible to argue with one another that solipsism cannot be defended, since by wanting to argue in its defense one has already thrown it overboard. See on this argument Karl R. Popper, *Conjectures and Refutations* (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), pp. 293ff.; idem, *Objective Knowledge* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp. 119ff., 235ff. See also K.O. Apel, *Transformation der Philosophie* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1973), vol. 2, part II, and Jürgen Habermas, *Legitimationsprobleme in Spätkapitalismus* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1973), note 160, p. 1521.

The putative causes of ::Y:: qua intentional act and the putative constants by means of which ::Y:: and these causes are brought into a relationship with one another are in truth nothing more significant than variables which have been found in contingent, covariant relationships with ::Y:: at particular points in time. It is also a purely contingent historico-mathematical fact (but not a confirmation of a hypothesis!) if these covariant relationships were reproduced exactly or even merely approximately with new data. It is in principle only coincidence that people in the same situation defined by the same set of variables act in the same way (bring the same knowledge to bear). For if one is able to learn it is obviously impossible to predict whether a person will actually learn or not from one point in time to the next. It can only be ascertained post festum, as an already established fact. Ultimately, any change in these kinds of covariant relationships must be seen as a contingent fact (and not as a falsification of a hypothesis!). For if one can learn, then not only is it impossible to predict whether one will actually learn in any particular situation, but it is equally impossible to predict what, if anything at all, one will learn.
