## Against Fiduciary Media

Almost all Austrian economists nowadays dey united for dia opposition for central banking and for dia support of banking system wey dey free and competitive. But, strong  debate don start on top de original meaning of “banking wey dey free and competitive.” Shey “free banking” nid 100-percent-reserve-deposit banking, abi na only  fractional reserve banking wey e fit allow or nid? For inside one article like dat wey show for de Review of Austrian Economics, George A. Selgin and Lawrence White, de two correct people wey study and come support de latest Austrian “free banking” since fractional reserve banking, don undertake systematic attempt wey dem go use answer dem plenty Austrian critics togeda with defender dem of 100-percentreserve-deposit banking.[^1]

Against de charges wey dem critics go make, Selgin and White don try to prove two theses like dat. First, dem claim to show say de practice of fractional reserve banking, wey be, de issue of fiduciary media, nor involve fraud but e dey justified by de principle of freedom of contract, and again dem argue say fractional reserve banking dey de same line with de title-transfer theory of contract wey  Murray N. Rothbard  develop (so tey Rothbard, who agree say fractional reserve banking na lie, don fail to even understand im own theory). Second, dem try to show say de creation of fiduciary media nor go lead to economic inefficiencies and discoordination by force but e fit help dem stop wahala wey be say he nor dey possible to stop before and dis one go improve economic performance well well. For inside de following, we go show say both central normative claim and secondary positive claim nor dey before

### De Wahala of Fraud I: Money, Money Substitutes, Fiduciary Media, togeda with Title-Transfer Theory of Contract

If we wan answer de question weda fractional reserve banking dey cause fraud or he nor dey cause, from de beginning we nid to explain some correct tori and terminological issues. But as we get luck reach, both de two side agree for de same matter, so cos of dat one we go dey brief well well. Money fit show for many form, just like Gold. If we take Gold as money, den we fit talk say money na de medium of exchange wey everybody accept,” so dat one go make us fit talk say "if we compare am to oda load, gold get value pass dem” (so tey “person fit use am buy anytin without any wahala”).[^3] Money substitutes, to put am anoda, fit be claims or titles for some kind amount of money wey be gold. If reserves of money (gold)  cover money substitute dem (paper notes), Mises dey call money substitute “money certificates,” and we go dey call them money substitutes for dis work. If money substitutes (paper notes) dey uncovered with money (gold), we go dey call dem fiduciary media.[^4]

On top dese assumptions with definition, we go fit answer de question of weda fraud dey inside Fiduciary Media now or not. But as we get luck reach de discussion on top this tori happen cos Selgin and White agree  say Rothbardian title transfer theory of contract dey correct. Since de issue say fiduciary media dey fraudulent, just like  Rothbard togeda with Hoppe claim, Selgin and White dey find 

> am hard to agree with Rothbard's title-transfer-theory of contract wey we agree on top, and wey Rothbard take use defend people make dem start private business with deir property wey dem get through correct way. Rothbard come talk say fraud na "failure to fulfill agreement wey dem use transfer property without force." So we fit talk say fractional-reserve arrangements na fraud. Weda one bank dey commit fraud by holding fractional reserves go depend on de terms of title-transfer agreement wey dey between de bank and dia customers.[^5]...

> Weda e dey fraudulent make we hold fractional reserves against  bank liability nor depend weda na demand abi time liability, but only on weda de bank don misrepresent imself say im dey hold 100 percent reserves. De demandability of one particular claim wey bank give, as in, de contractual option wey de holder fit collect at anytime, nor be representation say de bank dey hold 100 percent reserves against all of de claims wey dem fit demand. Rothbard come argue say, based on de view say bank dey like demand deposits with notes, dis one na confirm “warehouse receipts” nor be debts. We nor see reason why bank and dia customer nor fit agree with contract so dat dem go fit make dem debts instead of warehouse receipts, and we believe say historically dem don agree.[^6]

e fit sound like correct thing de first time, but e nor fit stand confam inspection. In fact, de passage wey dem quote show say dem don overlook de simple lesson wey concern property and contact. Just like Hoppe talk, "two people nor fit be de real owner of sometin wey be one de same time."[^7] Dis one na principle wey nor fit change; na law of action and nature wey no contract fit change or cancel. But, any contractual agreement wey involve say dem go present two different people as owners of de same tin (or we fit talk say, de same tin wey more dan one person get) na lie and e dey fraudulent. [^8] And dis na de fractional-reserve agreement wey dey between bank and dia customers.

If we wan issue and collect fiduciary note (with correct discounted price), bank and dia customer in fact, nor mata wetin dem believe or think about de transaction, don agree to represent dem sef - fraudulently- as de owner of one and de same object for de same time. Dem don come togeda to create anoda title and claim for de same existing quantity of property. If dem wan issue fiduciary note, dem nor dey do and dem nor fit bring plenty property into existence. So, no contract fit increase de existing quantity of property at all, but e fit transfer (redistribute) property wey don already dey ground from one person to anoda. De only way wey dem go fit increase de quantity of property wey don already dey ground na through addition of appropriation togeda with production (and so big quantity of property fit lead to de same increased number of titles for property). But fractional reserve banking with de issue of fiduciary media, wey nor dey and wey nor fit increase due to amount of property wey dey for existence, and again e nor involve (just like oda contracts be) transfer of existing property abi transfer of titles go existing property from one hand enter anoda. And de issue and acceptance of fiduciary note nor signify transfer of property from one bank to dia client or from one client to bank. If we wan dey sure well well, as de result of fiduciary issue dey, de distribution of assets and liabilities inside de accounts of bank and de client go dey altered. But existing quantity of property wey dem transfer from bank to dia client or from client to bank nor dey, and de total quantity of property wey dey, still remain as e dey. Instead, fiduciary media come represent new and additional titles to, or claims for stock of property wey dem neva change wey still dey exist. Dem nor be de result and documented outcome of additional supply of property for de part of de bank or dia client. Instead, dem represent additional supply of property titles, but de supply of property nor change. Na cos of dis we fit talk say dem create  fiduciary media from thin air. Dem be property-less titles wey dey search for property. Dis one na em be fraud, weda we follow Rothbard's definition say " failure wey dem go use fulfill transfer of property wey dem agree on" or according to Selgin and White definition say "na him be willful or deliberate deception for purpose of gain." every issuer and buyer of fiduciary note ( title to money, uncovered by money), weda person believe or not, na fact say dem engage am so dat misrepresentation go dey for purpose of personal gain. De bank and dia client dem don agree say dem go misrepresent demsef as de owners of a quantity of property wey dem nor get and wey nor even exist; and anytime wey dem buy existing quantity of property wey dem go use exchange titles for nonexisting quantity of property, dem don dey guilty of fraud.[^9]

Curiously, in the reply to their various critics, Selgin and White selected as their central target an article by Hans-Hermann Hoppe (“How is Fiat Money Possible?—or, The Devolution of Money and Credit,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 7, no. 2 (1994): 49–74, that deals only cursorily with their position. Other Austrian critics of fractional reserve banking explicitly dealt with in Selgin and White’s article including Walter Block, “Fractional Reserve Banking: An Interdisciplinary Perspective,” in *Man, Economy, and Liberty: Essays in Honor of Murray N. Rothbard*, Walter Block and Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., eds. (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988) and Jesús Huerta de Soto, “A Critical Analysis of Central Banks and Fractional-Reserve Free Banking from the Austrian Perspective,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 2 (1995): 25–36\. Murray N. Rothbard, the most prominent critic of fractional reserve banking, is targeted only indirectly; and although several of his works are mentioned in their bibliography, Rothbard’s later writings on the subject (“The Myth of Free Banking in Scotland,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 2 [1988]: 229–57; idem, “Aurophobia: or, Free Banking on What Standard?” *Review of Austrian Economics*, 6, no. 1 [1992]: 97–108; idem, “The Present State of Austrian Economics,” *Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines* 6, no. 2 [1995]) are not mentioned. Likewise ignored entirely are the criticisms by Joseph T. Salerno (“Two Traditions in Modern Monetary Theory: John Law and A.R.J. Turgot,” *Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines* 2, no. 2/3 [1991]; idem, “The Concept of Coordination in Austrian Macroeconomics,” in *Austrian Economics: Perspectives on the Past and Prospects for the Future*, Richard Ebeling, ed. [Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 1991]; and idem, “Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 6, no. 2 [1993]: 113–46). Selgin and White also do not address, and in this case could not have done so, the most recent and most extensive criticism of their work by Jörg Guido Hülsmann (“Free Banking and the Free Bankers,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 9, no. 1 [1996]: 3–53).

[^2]: As a doctrinal matter, Selgin and White also suggest that their view of fractional reserve banking coincides with Ludwig von Mises’s view; hence, they call themselves Misesians and claim it is the defenders of 100-percent-reserve banking who are deviationists. This claim can be rejected. In fact, Selgin (*The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue* [Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1988], pp. 60–63) has frankly acknowledged that Mises’s and his own views concerning fiduciary media are contradictory and White’s attempt to claim Mises as a proponent of fractional reserve free banking has been addressed by Salerno (“Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 6, no. 2 [1993]: 113–46). Here it suffices to provide a quotation from Mises:

> The main thing is that the government should no longer be in a position to increase the quantity of money in circulation and the amount of cheque-book money not fully—i.e., 100 percent—covered by deposits paid in by the public…. No bank must be permitted to expand the total amount of its deposits subject to cheque or the balance of such deposits of any individual customer … otherwise than by receiving cash deposits … or by receiving a cheque payable by another domestic bank subject to the same limitations. This means a rigid 100 per cent reserve for all future deposits; i.e., all deposits not already in existence on the first day of the reform. (*The Theory of Money and Credit* [Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1978], pp. 438 and 48)

[^4]: See Salerno, “Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 1 (1994): 71–115\. Selgin and White highlight the fact that Hoppe referred to them as proponents of “partial fiat money,” but then are ultimately compelled to admit that he did in fact not misrepresent their position as advocates of fractional reserve banking based on an underlying gold standard. Their complaint amounts to no more than a dispute over semantics. We will treat it as such here, too, and will concentrate instead exclusively on substantive disagreements.

There is actually more to the charge of Selgin and White being fiat money advocates in the article under scrutiny. For, in “the mature free-banking system,” according to Selgin and White (but in contrast to the analysis of the operation of such a system given by Mises), a situation is supposed to emerge in which

> At the limit, if inter-clearinghouse settlements were made entirely with other assets (perhaps claims on a super-clearinghouse which itself holds negligible commodity money), and if the public were completely weaned from holding commodity money, the active demand for the old-fashioned money commodity would be wholly nonmonetary. (Lawrence White, *Competition and Currency* [New York: New York University Press, 1989], p. 235)

Thus, notes Salerno (“Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 1 [1994]: 71–115, p. 76, n. 7) regarding Selgin and White’s ultimate objective, “the public would presumably finally be freed from its shackles of gold to enjoy the virtues of an invisible-hand-generated private fiat money.” Moreover, as far as semantic innovations and deviations from orthodox Misesian terminology, and hence potential sources of confusion are concerned, we have to consider Selgin and White’s own writings. For in referring to money and money substitutes as “outside and “inside” money respectively, in talking of “base money,” “basic money,” “bank money,” “high-powered” and “low-powered” money, and, yes, the gold dollar “as a substitute for bank deposits,” they display an unusual degree of semantic creativity. Moreover, in suggesting, by their selection of terms, that all of these things are somehow equally “money,” their writings actually have become a source of obfuscation. See on this Hülsmann, “Free Banking and the Free Bankers,” pp. 5ff.

[^7]: It is also “impossible that some time depositor and borrower are entitled to exclusive control over the same resources” (Hoppe, “How is Fiat Money Possible?”, p. 67).

[^8]: Even partners cannot simultaneously own the *same* thing. A and B can each own half of a household, or half the shares in it but they each own a *different* 50 percent. It is as logically impossible for them to own the same half as for two people to occupy the same space. Yes, A and B can both be in New York City at the same time, but only in different parts of it.

[^9]: Jesús Huerta de Soto (“A Critical Analysis of Central Banks,” p. 33) correctly likens the effect of fractional reserve banking to that of the so-called tragedy of the commons. Selgin and White (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media,” pp. 92–93, n. 12) object to de Soto’s analogy on the ground that the tragedy of the commons refers “to a particular sort of technological externality,” according to Selgin and White, involves “a physical or otherwise direct interference with someone’s consumption or production” and represents “interaction outside the market.” In contrast, write Selgin and White, the “externality from fiduciary media” is a harmless pecuniary “effect on someone’s wealth transmitted via the price system,” that is, through changes in the system of relative prices, and represents “an interdependence through the market.” Selgin and White err: an object and a title to an object are not the same thing.

In lumping money and money substitutes together under the joint title of “money,” as if they were somehow the same thing, Selgin and White fail to grasp that the issue of fiduciary media—an increase of property titles—is not the same thing as a larger supply of property and that relative price changes effected through the issue of fiduciary media are an entirely different “externality” matter than price changes effected through an increase in the supply of property. With this the fundamental distinction between property and a property title in mind, de Soto’s analogy between fractional reserve banking and the tragedy of the commons makes perfect sense. As under the scenario of a tragedy of the commons, every issue of fiduciary media—to titles in search of property—sets in motion a rush, always starting with the bank and its client, to fill these empty tickets with existing property; and in the course of this rush, invariably the first-comers will physically enrich themselves (through the appropriation of existing quantities of property) at the expense of a corresponding impoverishment of later-comers, whose quantity of existing property is physically diminished while they have been left with a larger number of property tickets.
