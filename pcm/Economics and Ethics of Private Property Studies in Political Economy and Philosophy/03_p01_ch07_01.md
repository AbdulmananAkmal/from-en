## Against Fiduciary Media

Almost all contemporary Austrian economists are united in their opposition to central banking and in their advocacy of a system of free competitive banking. However, a vigorous debate has arisen over the precise meaning of “free competitive banking.” Does “free banking” require 100-percent-reserve-deposit banking, or does it allow or even require fractional reserve banking? In a recent article that appeared in the *Review of Austrian Economics*, George A. Selgin and Lawrence White, the two most prominent contemporary Austrian proponents of “free banking” as fractional reserve banking, have undertaken a systematic attempt to answer their numerous Austrian critics and defenders of 100-percentreserve-deposit banking.[^1]

Against the charges made by their critics, Selgin and White try to establish two theses. First, they claim to show that the practice of fractional reserve banking, that is, the issue of fiduciary media, does not constitute fraud but is justified by the principle of freedom of contract, and in particular they contend that fractional reserve banking is in accordance with the title-transfer theory of contract as developed by Murray N. Rothbard (such that Rothbard, who holds that fractional reserve banking is fraudulent, must have failed to grasp his own theory). Second, they attempt to show that the creation of fiduciary media does not of necessity lead to economic inefficiencies and discoordination but may actually help prevent an otherwise unavoidable crisis and thus improve economic performance. In the following, we will demonstrate that neither the central normative claim nor the secondary positive claim is established.[^2]

### The Issue of Fraud I: Money, Money Substitutes, Fiduciary Media, and the Title-Transfer Theory of Contract

In order to resolve the question of whether or not fractional reserve banking constitutes fraud, from the outset a few factual assumptions and terminological issues will have to be clarified. Fortunately almost complete agreement on these matters exists on both sides of the debate, and thus we can be extremely brief. Money cannot but originate as a commodity, such as gold. Gold, then, as money is defined as “the generally acceptable medium of exchange,” and as such is uniquely characterized by its “supreme salability in comparison with all other assets” (such that its “possession puts one in the position of being able to make any potential purchase with minimum inconvenience”).[^3] Money substitutes, in turn, are defined as claims or titles to specified amounts of money gold. If money substitutes (paper notes) are fully covered by reserves of money (gold), Mises denotes them “money certificates,” and we will refer to them here simply as money substitutes. If money substitutes (paper notes) are uncovered by money (gold), they will be referred to as fiduciary media instead.[^4]

Based on these assumptions and definitions, we can now turn to the question of whether or not the issue of fiduciary media constitutes fraud. Fortunately the discussion of this issue is facilitated by the fact that Selgin and White explicitly accept the Rothbardian titletransfer theory of contract. That the issue of fiduciary media is inherently fraudulent, as Rothbard and Hoppe claim, Selgin and White find

> impossible to reconcile with Rothbard’s … title-transfer-theory of contract which we accept, and which Rothbard otherwise uses to defend the freedom of mutually consenting individuals to engage in capitalist acts with their (justly owned) property. Rothbard defines fraud as “failure to fulfill a voluntarily-agreed-upon transfer of property.” Fractional-reserve arrangements cannot then be *inherently* or *inescapably* fraudulent. Whether a particular bank is committing fraud by holding fractional reserves must depend on the terms of the title-transfer agreements between the bank and its customers.[^5] …
> 
> Whether it is fraudulent to hold fractional reserves against a bank liability does not depend *per se* on whether it is a demand or time liability, but only on whether the bank has misrepresented itself as holding 100 percent reserves. The demandability of a particular claim issued by a bank, i.e., the holder’s contractual option to redeem it at any time, is not *per se* a representation that the bank is holding 100 percent reserves against the total of its demandable claims. Rothbard argues otherwise, based on the view that a bank’s demand deposits and notes are necessarily “warehouse receipts” and not debts. We do not see why bank and customer cannot contractually agree to make them debts and not warehouse receipts, and we believe that historically they have so agreed.[^6]

While this may sound plausible at first glance, it does not withstand serious scrutiny. In fact, the quoted passage reveals that the most basic lesson concerning property and contract has been overlooked. As Hoppe formulated it, “two individuals cannot be the exclusive owner of one and the same thing at the same time.”[^7] This is an immutable principle; it is a law of action and nature that no contract can change or invalidate. Rather, any contractual agreement that involves presenting two different individuals as simultaneous owners of the same thing (or alternatively, the same thing as simultaneously owned by more than one person) is objectively false and thus fraudulent.[^8] Yet this is precisely what a fractional-reserve agreement between bank and customer involves.

In issuing and accepting a fiduciary note (at a necessarily discounted price), both bank and customer have *in fact*, regardless of whatever they may believe or think about the transaction, agreed to represent themselves—fraudulently—as the owner of one and the same object at the same time. They have in fact contracted to create additional titles and claims to the same existing quantity of property. In issuing fiduciary notes, they do not—and cannot—bring more property into existence. Indeed, no contract whatsoever can possibly increase the existing quantity of property, but can only transfer (redistribute) existing property from one person to another. The quantity of existing property can only be increased through additional appropriation and production (and a thus enlarged quantity of property can in turn lead to a correspondingly increased number of titles to property). But fractional reserve banking and the issue of fiduciary media, while it does not and cannot increase the amount of property in existence, also does not involve (as all other contracts do) a transfer of existing property or titles to existing property from one hand to another. Neither does the issue and acceptance of a fiduciary note signify a transfer of property from bank to client or vice versa. To be sure, as the result of a fiduciary issue, the distribution of assets and liabilities in the accounts of bank and client is altered. But no existing quantity of property is actually transferred from bank to client, or vice versa, and the total quantity of property in existence has remained unchanged. Rather, fiduciary media represent new and additional titles to or claims on an existing and unchanged stock of property. They are not the result and documented outcome of an additional supply of property on the part of the bank or its client. Instead, they represent an additional supply of property titles, while the supply of *property* has remained constant. It is precisely in this sense that it can be said of fiduciary media that they are created out of thin air. They are property-less titles in search of property. This, in and of itself, constitutes fraud, whether according to Rothbard’s definition of the term as “a failure to fulfill a voluntarily-agreed-upon transfer of property” or according to Selgin and White’s own definition of it as “a *willful* or *deliberate* deception for purposes of gain.” Each issuer and buyer of a fiduciary note (a title to money uncovered by money), regardless of what he may believe, is in fact—objectively—engaged in a misrepresentation for the purpose of personal gain. The bank and its client have consented to misrepresent themselves as the owners of a quantity of property that they do not own and that plainly does not exist; and whenever they buy an existing quantity of property in exchange for titles to a nonexisting quantity of property, they have become invariably and inescapably guilty of an act of fraudulent appropriation.[^9]

With plenty questions, inside wetin dem ansa people wey nor support dem, Selgin and White bin choose tori wey Hans-Hermann Hoppe bin write as dia central target ("How Fiat Money go dey possible?— or De Devolution of Money and Credit",Review of Austrian Economics, no. 2(1994): 49—74), wey talk about dia position.

Rothbard, wey be d main person wey nor support fractional reserve banking ; and even though dem mention plenty of him work for dia bibliography, wetin Rothbard’s later write on de mata(“The Myth of Free Banking in Scotland,” Review of Austrian Economics 2 [1988]: 229–57; idem, “Aurophobia: or, Free Banking on What Standard?” Review of Austrian Economics, 6, no. 1 [1992]: 97–108; idem, “The Present State of Austrian Economics,” Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines 6, no. 2 [1995]) nor dey mentioned.Anoda thing wey dem  ignore totally na de criticism wey Joseph T. Salerno do (“Two Traditions in Modern Monetary Theory: John Law and A.R.J.

Selgin and White nor follow talk about, and true true for dis one dem nor fit, de mata wey Jörg Guido Hülsmann write against wetin dem tok for inside-(“Free Banking and the Free Bankers,” Review of Austrian Economics 9, no. 1 [1996]: 3–53).

[^2]: As mata wey be like wetin person must follow, Segin and White don follow talk say wetin dem see as fractional reserve banking follow join with wetin Ludwig von Mises see; so dem dey call demselves Misesians and dem talk say na people wey dey support 100-percent-reserve banking wey be deviationists. Dis tok fit dey rejected cos Selgin for inside (The theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue[Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1988], pp.60—63) don gree say Mises with wetin him talk about fiduciary media nor dey de same and wetin White don talk about Mises as person  wey support fractional reserve banking don dey addressed by person wey be  Salerno ("Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized, Review Of Austrian Economics 6, no. 2[1993]: 113—46). Here e dey enough to drop quote from Mises wey tok say:

> de main thing na say make e nor be say na government go dey increase de quantity of money wey dey in circulation and de amount of cheque-book money wey nor dey fully, dat is, 100 percent—covered by deposits wey don dey paid in by de public…. No bank go dey permitted to expand de total amount of wetin don dey paid in to cheque or de balance of wetin don dey paid in by any customer … unless e go be by to receive cash wey  customer go pay… or by to receive cheque wey  anoda domestic bank fit pay wey dey under d same limits. Dis one mean say na 100 percent go dey ground for all deposits wey customers go do as time dey go on; as in  all deposits wey nor dey on d first day wey change start. (The Theory of Money and Credit [Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1978], pp. 438 and 48)

Selgin and White don write down d fact wey be say Hoppe bin talk say dem be people wey dey support "partial Fiat money", but dem dey moved to gree say im bin nor dey wrong wen im tok say dem dey in support of fractional reserve banking based on some kind standard wey don dey ground. Wetin dem dey complain nor pass simple wahala wey dey for English sha.We go treat am  and we go concentrate on dose kind wahala.

For matter wey we dey consider we fit see say oda tins follow for tori wey tok say Segin and White dey support fiat money.
according to  Selgin and White, (but nor be as Mises say e supoose be)e get how things suppose be wey be say

> as condition dey, if we wan do inter-clearing house settlements with oda things wey dey ground,  (maybe mata wey concern superclearing house wey  on im own contain small money to buy something) and if de people wey dey outside nor fit hold money wey dem go use buy things, den people  nor go dey nid money to get wetin suppose nid money to buy.(Lawrence White, Competition and Currency [New York: New York University Press, 1989], p. 235)

so, notes wey Salerno write (“Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought,” Review of Austrian Economics 8, no. 1 [1994]: 71–115, p. 76, n. 7) concerning wetin Selgin and White bin believe na say “de public go dey free finally from de bondage of gold wey go let dem enjoy d power of private fiat money wey we nor sabi who make am".But, as far as English dey change from de old Misesian Tori and confusion don dey set in, we go consider wetin Segin and White bin write. Dem say as we dey refer to money and wetin fit dey in place of money as "outside" and "inside" money, and as we dey talk of "basic money", "bank money", high-powered" and low-powered" money and de gold dollar as wetin fit dey in place of bank deposits, dem nor dey equal if we wan check dia meaning. But as dem don tok say all these tins na money, wetin dem write don bcome wetin dey confuse person. See for dis Hülsmann, “Free Banking and the Free Bankers,” pp. 5ff.

E dey impossible make dem get d same half wey dey like make two people dey de same space Yes, A and B fit dey New York City at de same point in time but dem go dey different parts of New York City.

[^9]: Jesús Huerta de Soto (“A Critical Analysis of Central Banks,” p. 33) dey correct as im talk say wetin fractional reserve banking dey cause na same as wetin de so-called tragedy of commons fit cause. Selgin and White (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media,” pp. 92–93, n. 12)sha no agree with wetin de Soto don talk bcos dem feel say tragedy of de commons mean say, to a point na sometin wey involve some kind block for wetin person suppose produce or chop and e follow show how people dey relate for outside de market. As dem nor agree,  Selgin and White, don write say de “externality from fiduciary media” na sometin wey nor fit wound person wey dey rich and e dey transmitted through how price dey change and e dey show how de market dey depend on one anoda. Selgin and White don tok say : sometin wey be object and name wey dem give object nor be de same thing.

As dem join money and wetin fit dey in place of money under de same name of "money" as if dem be de same tin, Selgin and White neva see say dis mater of fiduciary media wey be – increase ontop property titles – nor be same tin as supply of property wey dey bigger and dem neva see say change for price wey don come as fiduciary media don dey nor be d same matter as wen price change ontop supply of property. With dis tori, de difference between property and property name wey person get for mind, wey be wetin de Soto don talk between fractional reserve banking with palava wey follow commons dey legit. As e be for palava wey follow commons,every mata wey concern fiduciary media—to titles wey dey find property go just bring rush wey go start with de bank and de customer, wey go fill de tickets wey dey empty wit property wey don dey ground; and as dis rush dey go on, people wey first come go just dey rich(cos of wetin don dey ground before) and people wey dey late go dey poor, since property wey go dey ground go don reduce and property tickets go still plenty well well.
