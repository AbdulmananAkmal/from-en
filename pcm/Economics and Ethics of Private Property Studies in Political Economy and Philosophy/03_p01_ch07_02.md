Selgin and White’s nor gree recognise dis one, and dia belief for de ethical innocence of fractional reserve banking, na cos of two confusions. For one hand, as dem don already indicate, dem nor recognise say no object—and different person nor fit get any amount of money (gold)— for de same time and no contract fit increase de numba of de property wey dey ground, and cos of dat, any oda claim na fraud. For anoda hand, and intimately related, Selgin and White nor recognize de fundamental praxeological difference wey dey between property and property titles. But, for subsuming money (gold) and money substitutes (banknotes) unda de same heading of “money” dem continue to dey confuse dis difference so dem go hide de truth. Cos if dem define money (gold) and titles to money (banknotes) as “money,” then e nor show any difference  whether de supply of money abi dat of banknotes dey increase. Both of dem na “money” so, by definition, for both cases of de same event— increase for de supply of money—don take place be dat. But dis one nor change de mata say; e only comot dem from existence.

Of course, as Selgin and White don correctly show, everyone dey free to use any definition and even make any  distinction wey dem want. But upon dat definitions nor dey create real distinctions; But dem fit make dem disappear sha. De only tin wey dem fit do na to reflect de distinctions abi make dem ignore and confuse dem; and if we refer to both to both money and money substitutes indiscriminately as money na to hide the difference wey dey between two categorically—praxeologically—distinct phenomena and states of affairs. Tiitle for money and increase for titles nor be de same tin as money and increase of money. But, unlike increase for de quantity of money (gold) abi increase for titles wey dey backed by anoda increase of money, any increase for de quantity of titles to money wey no dey accompanied with another increased quantity of money necessarily mean say na more dan one person get de same quantity of money at de same time; and since dat kin tin nor dey possible—de quantity of money nor fit change and all na person must get all de money wey dey ground—every redemption of a fiduciary title, den, be it say e dey into money or abi any oda real property, involve act of illicit appropriation.

Assuming say both property and property titles (notes) exist. Apart from property wey dey consumer goods, producer goods, and money, titles to consumer goods, titles to producer goods, and titles to money dey assum say dem dey exist. De origin of property titles wit addition to de existence of property dey promotes legal certainty and e dey reduce and even facilitate legal disputes, so e undoubtedly represent beneficial (natural) development. E even allow two innovations self. For one hand, e dey possible make dem separate de act of transferring ownership in property from de act of transferring its possession. As in, e dey possible make dem surrender or acquire ownership for objects without simultaneously surrendering abi acquiring possession, disposition, and control of de same object. If we apply am to money e go dey possible say, all de while de ownership of de quantities of money (gold) wey dey ground before fit change constantly from one person to anoda, de entire quantity of money fit remain—unchangingly—for de hands of one and de same bank (since na him dey manage de  money of odas). For anoda hand, with de development of property titles, intertemporal exchanges go dey systematically facilitated. Dem fit transfer property wey dey ground abi dem fit transfer  titles  so that  dem fit use am exchange against titles to future property (debt claims); so we fit assume say next to titles to property wey dey exist before (consumer goods, producer goods, and money), titles (debt claims) to future consumer goods, future producer goods, together with future money dey exist and dem dey traded as well.

On top dese development, de following transactions (contracts) wey dey between any two parties A (bank client) and B (bank) dey possible. A fit transfer him money (gold) for B’s disposition and he fit (1) nor give up him ownership inside, abi (2) him fit give up him ownership. Anoda possibility no dey. If (1), den A keep de title for d sum of money wey he transfer to B; B nor get title to am, but he go dey act as person wey dey keep money (a bailee) for A (as a money bailor). Anoda possibility no dey. If (2), den B collect de title on top de quantity of money wey A keep for him hand; A go collect something from B in exchange either (a) consumer goods with/abi producer goods wey be say na B get am before; abi (b) consumer goods with/abi producer goods wey dey for B hand (but na A get am now) (an equity claim); abi (c) a title  for quantity of future consumer with/abi producer goods with/abi money (a debt claim). Again, anoda possibility nor dey. Dis one mean say, A nor fit retain ownership of dis property come transfer am to B.

Inside all dese transactions wey dey possible, nor one go fit result for de issue of a fiduciary note. Fiduciary media, according to Selgin and White’s own definition, be “dat portion of redeemable money substitutes wey dey backed by assets instead of base money.”[^10] E get money (gold) and money substitutes (titles to money) wey dey for existence, and e get titles to non-money goods (equity titles), and titles to not-yet-existing future goods (debt claims). Apparently, however, nothing like “money substitutes wey dey backed by assets oda dan base money” fit comot from any of dese transactions. Selgin and White assume de existence of fiduciary media (and dem come agree say de absence of fiduciary media happen because of legal restrictions), but dem nor provide praxeological explanation wit reconstruction of de origin like de peculiar entity wit state of affairs. Instead, dey only ask, why not? “We nor de reason why bank and deir customer nor fit contractually agree so dat dem fit make them [as in, demand deposits wit banknotes] debts and nor be warehouse receipts.” Why be say e fit be—and fit be say— money substitutes no dey backed wit assets oda dan money? For de same reason wey be say car abi houses title fit dey backed or he fit nor dey backed by assets oda dan cars abi houses, say equity titles fit dey backed abi e fit nor dey backed with assets wey dey different from equity, and say more dan one person nor fit get assets—money, equity, abi debt (backed) at de same time. Titles to money are—and should be—backed by money in the same way and for the same reason as titles to cars are and should be backed by cars. This is what defines them as property titles. It is in accordance with and a reflection of the nature of property and property titles. In distinct contrast, a title to money backed by assets other than money is a contradiction in terms, and its issue and use involves the same sort of objective misrepresentation as the issue of a title to a car backed by assets other than a car (parts of planes and bikes, for instance).[^11]

The answer to why fractional reserve agreements are ethically impermissible, and why there can be no contracts to make warehouse receipts debt, is that such agreements and contracts contradict (deny) the nature of things. Any such contract is from the outset—a priori—invalid. Selgin and White try to get around this inescapable conclusion by adopting, wittingly or not, an ultra-subjectivist view of contracts and agreements. According to this view, the very fact that a voluntary agreement is reached and/or a contract is concluded demonstrates that it must be a valid—true or permissible—agreement and contract. Yet this view is not only false, it is also incompatible with Rothbard’s title-transfer theory of contract that these authors claim to have accepted. Agreements and contracts per se do not imply anything regarding their validity for the fundamental reason that agreements and contracts do not create reality, but rather presuppose it. More specifically, contracts do not bring property into existence, but rather recognize and transfer existing property. Hence, as in Rothbard’s ethical system, the theory of property must precede the treatment of contracts. Contracts and contract theory presuppose and are constrained by property and property theory. That is, the range of possible (valid) contracts is limited and restricted by the existing quantity (stock) of property and the nature of things, rather than the other way around. Thus, agreements regarding flying elephants, centaurs, squared circles, of *perpetui mobile*, for instance, are invalid contracts. They cannot—by virtue of biological, physical, or mathematical law—be fulfilled, and are from the outset false and fraudulent.

While Selgin and White may acknowledge this, they fail to recognize that a fractional reserve banking agreement implies no lesser an impossibility and fraud than that involved in the trade of flying elephants or squared circles. In fact, the impossibility involved in fractional reserve banking is even greater. For, whereas the impossibility of contracts regarding flying elephants, for instance, is merely a contingent and empirical one (it is not inconceivable that in another possible world, somewhere and sometime, flying elephants may actually exist, thus making such contracts possible), the impossibility of fractional reserve banking contracts is a necessary and categorical one. That is, it is inconceivable—praxeologically impossible—that a bank and a customer can agree to make money substitutes (banknotes, demand deposit accounts) debts instead of warehouse receipts. They may say or certify otherwise, of course, just as one may say that triangles are squares. But what they say would be objectively false. As triangles would remain triangles and be different from squares, so money substitutes would still be money substitutes (titles to present money) and be distinct from debt claims (titles to not yet existing future goods) and equity claims (titles to existing property other than money). To say otherwise does not change reality but objectively misrepresents it.

In doing what Selgin and White believe clients and banks to have done—to agree to make warehouse receipts debt—the money depositor A receives from the bank B a claim to present money, rather than a debtor equity title. That is, A does not in fact give up ownership of the deposited money (as would have been the case if he had received a debtor equity claim from B). While A retains title to the money deposit, however, B does not treat A’s deposit as a bailment, but rather as a loan, and enters it as an asset onto its own (B’s) balance sheet (offset by an equal sum of outstanding demand liabilities). While this may appear initially to be merely a harmless accounting practice, it involves from the outset a misrepresentation of the real state of affairs.[^12] Since both, B as well as A, count the same quantity of money simultaneously among their own assets, they have in effect conspired to represent themselves in their financial accounts as owning a larger quantity of property than they actually own: that is, they have become financial impostors.[^13] Though fraudulent, this would not matter so much if everything were left at this. However, as soon as B acts as if things were the way he represents them on his balance sheet to be—as if the bank owned the deposited money and only had the obligation to redeem outstanding warehouse receipts on demand—mere misrepresentation is turned into misappropriation. If B, in accordance with this misrepresentation, lends out money, or more likely, issues additional warehouse receipts for money and lends these out to some third party C, in the expectation of eventually being repaid principal and interest, the bank becomes engaged in undue appropriation, because what it lends out to C—whether money or titles to money—is in fact not its (B’s) own property but that of someone else (A). It is this fact—that the title transferred from B to C concerns property B does not own—that makes fractional reserve banking from the outset fraudulent.

It is not the case, as is claimed, that fraud (breach of contract) is committed only if B, the fractional reserve bank, is actually unable to fulfill all requests for redemption as they arise. Rather, fraud is also committed each time B does fulfill its redemption obligations. Because whenever B redeems a fractionally covered banknote into money (gold) (whenever a note holder takes possession of his property), it does so with someone else’s money: if B redeems C’s note, it does so with money owned by A, and if A wants his money too, B pays him with money owned by D, and so on. Qua defenders of fiduciary media and fractional reserve banking, Selgin and White would have to maintain that there is no breach of contract as long as B is able to fulfill its contractual obligations with *someone else’s* property (money).

Yet this is patently wrong, and it stands in clear contradiction to Rothbard’s title transfer theory of contract that Selgin and White claim to have accepted. In accordance with Rothbard’s contract theory, individuals are only entitled to make contracts regarding the transfer of *their own property*. In contrast, fractional reserve banking, by its very nature (even if it is practiced successfully), involves contracts concerning the transfer of *other people’s property*. Hence this practice—the issue of fiduciary media—is in principle (inherently) incompatible with the title-transfer theory of contract—and it turns out, not surprisingly, that it is Rothbard, and not his two interpreters, who ultimately demonstrates a better grasp of his own contract theory.

[^11]: Similar logic-semantic confusions are at work when Selgin and White try to reduce the difference between demand and time liabilities to one of degree rather than kind (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media,” p. 90). Explains Selgin:

> Holders of demand liabilities are granters of credit just as are holders of time liabilities. The only difference is that in the former case the duration of individual loans is unspecified; they are “call loans” that may mature at any time;

and “Mises,” who holds the opposite view, “confuses a difference of degree with one of substance” (Selgin, *The Theory of Free Banking*, p. 62). In fact, it is Selgin who is confused.

To be sure, one might say that it is only a matter of degree whether a loan (of a car or of money) matures in an hour, a day, a week, or a month. Just as surely, however, this does not change the categorical distinction between present—existing—goods and not (yet) existing future goods. At any point in time, a car or a sum of money (gold) either exists or it does not exist. Nor does it alter the praxeological datum that no one, at any time, can act with anything except present goods. Future goods are the goal of actions, but in order to attain them, every actor must first invariably employ present means goods. Nor does Selgin’s observation concerning degrees of time affect in the slightest the fundamental human condition of scarcity. The supply of present goods is at all times limited, and the limited quantity of present goods limits in turn the quantity of possible future goods.

Whereas Mises recognizes the distinction between present goods and future goods as a universal praxeological category, Selgin’s attempt to conflate demand and time deposits (thus distinguish himself fundamentally from Mises) implies a denial that there is no such fundamental difference between present (existing) goods and future (not-existing) goods (or that their existence differs only in degrees). Contrary to Selgin, it is not a matter of degree but rather one of substance whether a car or a sum of money presently exists or not, and whether one person or someone else owns them. Either they exist or they don’t exist, and either A owns them or someone else does. Accordingly if a property title (demand deposit note) then states that one person is the owner of a present car or present money and no car or money exists, or the car or money is presently owned by someone else, this does not represent a degree of truth but a falsehood. Explains Mises:

> A depositor of a sum of money who acquires in exchange for it a claim convertible into money at any time which will perform exactly the same service for him as the sum it refers to has exchanged no present good for a future good. The claim that he has acquired by his deposit is also a present good for him. The depositing of money in no way means that he has renounced immediate disposal over the utility that it commands. (*The Theory of Money and Credit,* p. 268)

[^12]: See on this point Rothbard. “How,” asks Rothbard,

> do these warehouse receipt transactions relate to the T-account balance sheets of the deposit banks? In simple justice, not at all. When I store a piece of furniture worth $5,000 in warehouse, in law and in justice the furniture does *not* show up as an asset of the warehouse during the time that I keep it there. The warehouse does not add $5,000 to both its assets and liabilities because it in no sense *owns* the furniture; neither can we say that I have *loaned* the warehouse the furniture for some indefinite time period. The furniture is mine and remains mine; I am only keeping it there for safekeeping and therefore I am legally and morally entitled to redeem it any time I please. I am not therefore the bank’s “creditor”; it doesn’t *owe* me money which I may some day collect. Hence, there is no debt to show up on the Equity + Liability side of the ledger. Legally, the entire transaction is not a loan but a *bailment*. (*The Mystery of Banking* [New York: Richardson and Snyder, 1983], pp. 88–89)

Interestingly, while Selgin and White manifest a strong positivistic tendency (fractional reserve banking is recognized by the courts, so it must be all right; on this tendency see “The Issue of Fraud III” below), they do not come to terms with legal reality. For if money deposits are debt, why, then, don’t the courts apply the same reasoning to all other fungible commodities such as wheat? Why are wheat warehouse receipts not considered a debt but a bailment by the courts? Why is this treatment peculiar to money and the banking business? Moreover, why is it that the courts, even if they falsely consider money deposits as debts, still insist that they are more than an ordinary debt, and the depositor’s relation to the bank is not identical with that of an ordinary creditor? See Rothbard, *Mystery of Banking*, p. 275.

[^13]: See also William Stanley Jevons (*Money and the Mechanism of Exchange* [London: Kegan Paul, 1905], pp. 206–12, 221), who lamented the existence of general deposits since it has “become possible to create a fictitious supply of a commodity, that is, to make people believe that a supply exists which does not exist.” On the other hand, special deposits, such as “bills of lading, pawn-tickets, dock-warrants, or certificates which establish ownership to a definite object,” are superior because “they cannot possibly be issued in excess of the good actually deposited, unless by distinct fraud.” And Jevons concluded that “it used to be held as a general rule of law, that a present grantor assignment of goods not in existence is without operation.”
