### From Commodity Money to Fiat Money: The Devolution of Money

If money must arise as a commodity money, how can it become fiat money? It does so via the development of money substitutes (paper titles to commodity money)—but only fraudulently and only at the price of economic inefficiencies.

Under a commodity money standard such as the gold standard until 1914, money “circulated” on the one hand in the form of standardized bars of bullion and gold coins of various denominations trading against each other at essentially fixed ratios according to their weight and fineness. On the other hand, to economize on the cost of storing (safekeeping) and transacting (clearing) money, in a development similar to that of transferable property titles—including stock and bond certificates—as means of facilitating the spatial and temporal exchange of *non*money goods, side by side with money proper also gold certificates—property titles (claims) to specified amounts of gold deposited at specified institutions (banks)—served as a medium of exchange. This coexistence of money proper (gold) and money substitutes (claims to money) affects neither the total supply of money—for any certificate put into circulation an equivalent amount of gold is taken out of circulation (deposited)—nor the interpersonal income and wealth distribution. Yet without a doubt the coexistence of money and money substitutes and the possibility of holding money in either form and in variable combinations of such forms constitutes an added convenience to individual market participants. This is how intrinsically worthless pieces of paper can acquire purchasing power. If and insofar as they represent an unconditional claim to money and if and insofar as no doubt exists that they are valid and may indeed be redeemed at any time, paper tickets are bought and sold *as if* they are genuine money—they are traded against money at par. Once they have thus acquired purchasing power and are then deprived of their character as claims to money (by somehow suspending redeemability), they may continue functioning as money. As Mises writes:

> Before an economic good begins to function as money it must already possess exchange-value based on some other cause than its monetary function. But money that already functions as such may remain valuable even when the original source of its exchange-value has ceased to exist.[^9]

However, would self-interested individuals *want* to deprive paper tickets of their character as titles to money? Would they *want* to suspend redeemability and adopt intrinsically worthless pieces of paper as money? Paper money champions like Milton Friedman claim this to be the case, and they typically cite a savings-motive as the reason for the substitution of fiat for commodity money: A gold standard involves social waste in requiring the mining and minting of gold. Considerable resources have to be devoted to the production of money.[^10] With essentially costless paper money instead of gold, such waste would disappear, and resources would be freed up for the production of directly useful producer or consumer goods. It is thus a fiat money’s higher economic efficiency which explains the present world’s universal abandonment of commodity money. But is it so? Is the triumph of fiat money indeed the outcome of some innocuous saving? Is it even conceivable that it could be? Can self-interested individuals really *want* to save as fiat money champions assume that they do?

Somewhat closer scrutiny reveals that this is impossible, and that the institution of fiat money requires the assumption of a very different—not innocuous but sinister—motive: Assume a monetary economy with (at least) one bank and money proper (“outside money” in modern jargon) as well as money substitutes (“inside money”) in circulation. If market participants indeed wanted to save on the resource costs of a commodity money (with the ultimate goal of demonetizing gold and monetizing paper), one would expect that first—as an approximation to this goal—they would want to give up using any outside money (gold). All transactions would have to be carried out with inside money (paper), and all outside money would have to be deposited in a bank and thus taken out of circulation entirely (Otherwise, as long as genuine money was still in circulation, those individuals making use of gold coins would demonstrate unmistakably—through their very actions—that they did *not* want to save on the associated resource costs.)

However, is it possible that money substitutes can thus outcompete and displace genuine money as a medium of exchange? Even many hard money theoreticians have been too quick to admit such a possibility. The reason is that money substitutes are *substitutes* and have one permanent and decisive disadvantage as compared to money proper. Paper notes (claims to money) are redeemable at par only to the extent that a deposit fee has been paid to the depositing institution. Providing safeguarding and clearing services is a costly business, and a deposit fee is the price paid for guarded money. If paper notes are presented for redemption after the date up to which safeguarding fees were paid by the original or previous depositor, the depositing institution would have to impose a redemption charge and such notes would then trade at a discount against genuine money. The disadvantage of money substitutes is that they must be continuously redeposited and re-issued in order to maintain their character as money—their salability at par—and thus that they function as money only temporarily and discontinuously. Only money proper (gold coins) is permanently suited to perform the function as a medium of exchange. Accordingly, far from inside money ever displacing outside money, the use of money substitutes should be expected to be forever severely limited—restricted essentially to the transaction of very large sums of money and the dealings between regular commercial traders—while the overwhelming bulk of the population would employ money proper for most of their purchases or sales, thus demonstrating their preference for *not* wanting to save in the way fancied by Friedman.[^11]

Moreover, even if one assumed for the sake of argument that only inside money is in circulation while all genuine money is stored in a bank, the difficulties for fiat money proponents do not end here. To be sure, in their view matters appear simple enough: All commodity money sits idle in the bank. Wouldn’t it be more efficient if all of this idle gold were used instead for purposes of consumption or production—for dentistry or jewelry—while the function of a medium of exchange were assumed by a less expensive—indeed, practically costless—fiat money? Not at all.

First, to imagine to remove gold as money no mean say bank fit claim d whole money for supply, and de public go con keep de note. No person apart from person wey get bank to agree to dat am! Nobody wan *dat kind* savings. In fact, dis no go be savings at all but na way to extort de public and na only de bank dey gain. Nobody go like *wan* anoda person extort am. (Yet de extortion of person own commodity money thru governments and dia central banks na de only method wey be say commodity money don dey replaced by paper money.) Instead, each person wey dey deposit go wan retain de ownership of em deposits and collect em gold back.

Den, even so, one kunk problem con come up: No matter who- de bank or de public get de notes now, dem be like paper wey no fit recover. Before, de amount wey dey attach to dey produce dat kind paper no jux be one to take dey print paper tickets, but na importantly to dey attract doz wey dey deposit gold by to dey provide protection and to clear services.  Now, wit paper wey no fit recova notin dem fit dey guide again. The amount to take dey produce money con turn zero, to ordinary printing amount. Before, wey paper be like gold, de note don get power dey buy. But how de bank or public fit make people dey collect dem now? Dem fit use am buy and sell for goods wey no need money for de former normal percentage to exchange? Clear say no be so. As far as say no court case concerning to dey produce note ver dey; wey dey unda competition for free entry, if de (nonmoney) price dem pay for paper note pass de amount dem dem produce am, to de produce note go reach one big point wey de price of money go reach em amount to take produce am. De result na say tins go expensive. No person go collect paper money again, and movement enter *real value* go con enter. De economy wey involve money go crash totally and de society go con go back to de olden days, too much trade by barter method. As den comot for barter, new one go show (fit be gold) commodity money go come up (and dos wey dey produce note again, so make people accept dia note, go start use dem as money). See diz way to take dey save!

If person go succeed to try replace commodity money by paper money, den, em must fulfil added requirement: Em must stop free entry to enta de business to dey produce-note, and dem must establish money *monopoly*. One common person wey dey make paper money fit make tins cost anyhow and money karst. But as far as say, dem hold am wit law from em rival, monopolist fit by himself reduce how em go take dey produce em note and make sure say dem retain dia value of to take buy tins. Em go con reason de task of to dey *recover* em old note for de same level wit new de one, as dat one wey dey provide security and clearing service to dey accept note deposit con exchange am by to dey issue oda type of note- dey ask for deposit account and checkbook money- against charge for deposit.

Concerning diz mata, some kind question con come up. Before wit commodity money dem dey permit every persin to go dey dig gold and do coin business wit open mind- to dey follow de reason of people wey too like demself and people wey dey gada property. De difference, for Friedman “paper money gain” to happen, dem go need to comot competition con make monopoly stand. Even wit dat one dem fit make peace wit legit monopoly wit people wey too like demself? Em fit happen say people wey like make paper money stand fit still gree as dem dey normally gree for de dvision of work to dey use one and de same commodity take dey do exchange? If nor be so, em show show say de mount wey dey attach wit day kind monopoly dem go reason am big pass all de amount of de tins dem dey save?

To dey bring up dis kind question na to answer dem. Monopoly and to dey pursue personal-interest no dey align. To dey sure, reason why person fit wan become money monopolist dey exist. After all, no be to dey store, guide and recova precious commodity, de amound dem take dey make am go reduce well well and de monopolist go get extra gain. To dey protected by de law from future competition, dis profit from monopoly go turn “capitalized” (em go show permanently high money for em property), and on top em property money dem increase em suppose dey sure of normal rate of return thru interest. Even to talk say dat kind arrangement go benefit de monopolist no be to say em go favour anoda person, also em fit start naturally. In fact, no get reason for any person to dey like *any person dan himself* make em be de monopolist, and normally no agreement on how to dey select any particular monopolist go dey possible. De power of monopolist fit dey arrogant- dem force am against people wey no like monopolists. To define am, monopoly dey cause difference between two different people for different level: concerning dos- people dem allow to dey produce money and de small people- people wey, to de advantage of de fomer, dem no dey allow to do de same. Dem no fit support dat kind institution for de same freeway as de institution of de division of labor and commodity money. Em *no*, be as em be, de “natural” result of combine advantage to dey interact, but na one-sided advantage to thief. Normally, instead of to dey rely for em usual existence thru free support and cooperation, monopoly need to put fear of kasala.[^12]

Afta all, self-interest no align and monopoly no dey end once dem don create de monopoly but dey continue as far as say de monopoly dey work. Em no fit but dey work abnormally for de cost of nonmonopolists dem comot. First, for unda time wey free competition dey (free entry), every person wey dey produce always dey unda pressure to dey produce wetin em dey make for price dem reduce, if em *no* do like dat, em go carry risk say na new people go comot am who dey make dey product for small money. Against diz one, one single person wey dey control tins wey dem comot from de competition, no dey unda dat kind disturbance. In short, since de amount dem take dey do money include one person wey dey control tins own salary wey join em award wey money no involve, de monopolists “natural” choice na to *raise* em costs. From here, em suppose expect say de amount for one person to dey produce paper money go soon, if em no be from de beginning, *pass* dos wey concern commodity money wey eye too dey.

Furthermore, it can be predicted that the price of monopolistically provided paper money will steadily increase and the purchasing power per unit money, and its quality will continuously fall. Protected from new entrants, every monopolist is always tempted to raise price and lower quality. Yet this is particularly true of a money monopolist. While other monopolists must consider the possibility that price increases (or quality decreases) due to an elastic demand for their product may actually lead to reduced revenues, a money monopolist can rest assured that the demand for his particular product—the common medium of exchange—will be highly inelastic. Indeed, short of a hyperinflation, when the demand for money disappears entirely, a money monopolist is practically always in a position in which he may assume that his revenue from the sale of money will increase even as he raises the price of money (reduces its purchasing power). Equipped with the exclusive right to produce money and under the assumption of self-interest the monopoly bank should be expected to engage in a steady increase of the money supply, for while an increased supply of paper money does not add anything to social wealth—the amount of directly useful consumer and producer goods in existence—but merely causes inflation (lowers the purchasing power of money), with each additional note brought into circulation the monopolist can increase *his* real income (at the expense of lowering that of the non-monopolistic public). He can print notes at practically zero cost and then turn around and purchase *real* assets (consumer or producer goods) or use them for the repayment of *real* debts. The real wealth of the non-bank public will be reduced—they own less goods and more money of lower purchasing power. However, the monopolist’s real wealth will increase—he owns more non-money goods (and he always has as much money as he wants). Who, in this situation, except angels, would *not* engage in a steady expansion of the money supply and hence in a continuous depreciation of the currency?

It may be instructive to contrast the theory of fiat money as outlined above to the views of Milton Friedman, as the outstanding modern champion of fiat money.

While the younger Friedman paid no systematic attention to the question of the origin of money the older Friedman recognizes that, as a matter of historical fact, all monies originated as commodity monies (and all money substitutes as warehouse claims to commodity money), and he is justly skeptical of the older Friedrich A. Hayek’s proposal of competitively issued fiat currencies.[^13] However, misled by his positivist methodology Friedman fails to grasp that money (and money substitutes) *cannot* originate in any other way and accordingly that Hayek’s proposal must fail.

In contrast to the views developed here, throughout his entire work Friedman maintains that a commodity money in turn would be “naturally” replaced by a—more efficient, resource cost saving—fiat money regime. Amazingly, however, he offers no argumentative support for this thesis, evades all theoretical problems, and whatever argument or empirical observation he does offer *contradicts* his very claim. There is, first off, no indication that Friedman is aware of the fundamental limitations of replacing outside money by inside money. Yet if outside money cannot disappear from circulation, how, except through an act of expropriation, can the link between paper and a money commodity be severed? The continued use of outside money in circulation demonstrates that it is *not* regarded as an inferior money; and the fact that expropriation is needed for the decommoditization of money would demonstrate that fiat money is *not* a natural phenomenon!

Interestingly, after evading the problem of explaining how the suspension of redeemability can possibly be considered natural or efficient, Friedman quite correctly recognizes that fiat money cannot, for the reasons given above, be provided competitively but requires a monopoly. From there he proceeds to assert that “the production of fiat currency is, as it were, a natural monopoly.”[^14] However, from the fact that fiat money requires a monopoly, it does not follow that there is anything “natural” about such a monopoly and Friedman provides no argument whatsoever as to how any monopoly can possibly be considered the natural outcome of the interactions of self-interested individuals. Moreover, the younger Friedman in particular appears to be almost completely ignorant of classical political economy and its antimonopolistic arguments: the axiom that if you give someone a privilege he will make use of it, and hence the conclusion that every monopolistic producer will be inefficient (in terms of costs as well as of price and quality). In light of these arguments it has to be regarded as breathtakingly naive on Friedman’s part first to advocate the establishment of a governmental money monopoly and then to expect this monopolist *not* to use its power, but to operate at the lowest possible costs and to inflate the money supply only gently (at a rate of 3–5 percent per year). This would assume that, along with becoming a monopolist, a fundamental transformation in the self-interested nature of mankind would take place.

Having had extensive experience with his own ideal of a world of pure fiat currencies as it came into existence after 1971 and looking back on his own central resource cost savings argument for a monopolistically provided fiat money of nearly four decades earlier, it is not surprising that the older Friedman cannot but acknowledge that his predictions turned out blatantly false.[^15] Since abolishing the last remnants of the gold commodity money standard, he realizes, inflationary tendencies have dramatically increased on a worldwide scale; the predictability of future price movements has sharply decreased; the market for long-term bonds (such as consols) has been largely wiped out; the number of investment and “hard money” advisors and the resources bound up in such businesses have drastically increased; money market funds and currency futures markets have developed and absorbed significant amounts of real resources which otherwise—without the increased inflation and unpredictability—would not have come into existence at all or at least would never have assumed the same importance that they now have; and finally it appears that even the direct resource costs devoted to the production of gold accumulated in private hoards as a hedge against inflation have increased.[^16] But what conclusion does Friedman draw from this empirical evidence? In accordance with his own positivist methodology according to which science is prediction and false predictions falsify one’s theory, one should expect that Friedman would finally discard his theory as hopelessly wrong and advocate a return to commodity money. Not so. Rather, in a remarkable display of continued ignorance (or arrogance), he emphatically concludes that none of this evidence should be interpreted as “a plea for a return to a gold standard. On the contrary I regard a return to a gold standard as neither desirable nor feasible.”[^17] Now as then he holds onto the view that the appeal of the gold standard is merely “nonrational, emotional,” and that only a fiat money is “technically efficient.”[^18] According to Friedman, what needs to be done to overcome the obvious shortcomings of the current fiat money regime is find

> some anchor to provide long-term price predictability, some substitute for convertibility into a commodity or, alternatively some device that would make predictability unnecessary. Many possible anchors and devices have been suggested, from monetary growth rules to tabular standards to the separation of the medium of exchange from the unit of account. As yet, no consensus has been reached among them.[^19]

[^11]: Indeed, historically this has been the case: Traditionally, notes have always been widely distrusted, and their acceptability—as compared to that of genuine money such as gold or silver coins—was severely limited.

::::In order to increase the popularity of money substitutes two complementary measures were actually required: First, the note-issuing depositing institution had to overvalue deposit notes against genuine money by either charging no depositing fee or by even paying interest on deposits. Secondly, because the guarding of money is actually *not* costless and deposited money *cannot* possibly generate an interest return, the bank, in order to cover its otherwise unavoidable losses, had to engage in fractional reserve banking, i.e., it had to issue and bring into circulation new, additional deposit tickets that, while physically indistinguishable from any other notes, were actually not covered by genuine money.

::::On the ethical and economic status of the practice of fractional-reserve banking see the section, “From Deposit and Loan Banking to Fractional-Reserve Banking: The Devolution of Credit,” below.

[^12]: It might be argued that a monopoly agreement would be possible (conceivable), if the monopolistic bank of issue were owned by—and its profits distributed to—everyone. Wouldn’t everyone, then, not just the monopolist, profit from the savings of substituting paper for gold?

::::In fact, such an agreement is illusionary. Joint ownership of the monopoly bank would imply that tradeable stock certificates must be issued and distributed. But who should get how much stock? Bank clients, according to their deposit size? Yet all private holders of notes help save on gold and would want to be included among the bank owners according to the size of their note holdings. What about the owners and sellers of nonmoney goods? In showing themselves willing to accept paper instead of gold, they, too, play their part in the resource cost savings. But how in the world is one to determine how many shares to award *them* when their contribution consists, as it does, of various quantities of heterogeneous consumer and producer goods? Here, at the very latest it would become impossible to reach agreement.

::::Moreover, why would any new market participant—any later deposit, note and/or nonmoney good owner *not* initially endowed with bank stock—want to consent to and support this arrangement? Why should he *pay* for banking stock, while it was distributed to the initial wealth owners free of charge, even though he is now involved in resource cost savings just as much as they were then? Such an arrangement would involve a systematic redistribution of income and wealth in favor of all initial wealth owners and at the expense of all later ones. Yet if new additional bank stock were issued for each new deposit, note, or nonmoney good owner, such stock would be worthless from the outset and any bank offering it would be a nonstarter.

::::In addition, as will be explained below, regardless of how the ownership problem is resolved, the very operation of the bank will—indeed *must*—have effects on the interpersonal income and wealth distribution.

In fact, the price of gold rose. At one point it reached $850 per ounce, and for most of the time it has lingered between $300 and $400\. As of this writing the price is $375.

::::Among the suggestions for an alternative fiat money “anchor” recently considered by Friedman, the “frozen monetary base rule” deserves a brief comment (see Friedman, “Monetary Policy for the 1980s” in *To Promote Prosperity*, John H. Moore, ed. [Stanford: Hoover Institution, 1984]). In one respect this rule represents an advance over his earlier 3 to 5 percent monetary growth rule. His advocacy of the latter rule was based essentially on the erroneous proto-Keynesian notion that money constitutes part of social capital, such that an economy cannot grow by 5 percent unless it is accommodated to do so by a proportional increase in the money supply. In contrast, the frozen monetary base rule indicates a recognition of the old Humean insight that any supply of money is equally optimal or, in Friedman’s own words, that money’s “usefulness to the community as a whole does not depend on how much money there is (Friedman, *Money Mischief*, p. 28). Otherwise, the proposal represents no advance at all, for how in the world can a monopolist be expected to follow a frozen monetary base rule any more than a less stringent 3 to 5 percent growth rule?

::::Moreover, even if this problem were solved miraculously, this would still not alter the monopoly’s character as an instrument of unilateral expropriation and income and wealth redistribution. The monopolist, apart from offering depositing and clearing services (for which his customers would pay him a fee), would also have to perform the function, for customers and noncustomers alike, of replacing old, worn-out notes—one-to-one and free of charge—with new, identical ones (otherwise, who would want to replace a permanent commodity money by a perishable fiat money?). However, while the costs associated with this task may be low, they are definitely not zero. Accordingly, in order to avoid losses and recoup his expenses, the monopolist cannot but *increase* the monetary base—and hence one would essentially be back at the older monetary growth rule.
