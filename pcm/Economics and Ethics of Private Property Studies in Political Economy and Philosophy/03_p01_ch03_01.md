## Banking, Nation States, and International Politics: A Sociological Reconstruction of de Present Economic Order

### Money and Banking

For make we explain as barter carry come out, we nor need anytin pass de assumption sef interest. As far as man dey like plenty choice dem and goods dem pass small ones, im go choose barter and division of labour instead of sef-sufficiency.

As money take come out from barter sef, follow for de same narrow sef-interest. If dem put man inside barter economy, and im come choose high standard of living instead of lower, im go also choose and support one common way to exchange. As im choose de type money wey im want, im go fit overcome de restriction wey barter economy don put on top exchange dem, as in de one wey go need double coincidence of want to happen. With money e go dey possible for to do exchange. Im go fit exchange every goods with anoda ones, de goods nor go depend on top double coincidence or divisibility dem wey nor dey perfect. And as de exchangeability don wide so, de value of goods wey im get go increase.

Just as if dem don put man for inside one exchange economy, sef-interest go make am dey look for some kind goods dem wey go fit sell, we get de kind money property dem wey im want, like goods wey im fit divids, goods wey go last, good wey people fit recognise, goods wey dem fit carry and good wey nor too dey ground, and to ask for dose kind goods sake of  to use dem as media exchange. And na for im own interest to choose dat goods as im own medium of exchange just as oda people dey follow use am. Infact na the work of money to help de exchange wake, to am dey very possible for ezchnage to happen, and dat way im go also increase de value of goods dem (to de point wey dem go look like dem follow for exchange economy). And so, de more wey people dey use commodity as money , de more wey de commodity go do im work as money. And as sef-interest go be wetin dey push am, man go always like medium of exchange wey dey general, and universal pass de one wey nor dey less general and wey nor dey universal. For as de money common reach, na so de market wey person dey inside go wide, and na so value and cost calculation go make sense (from de way wey person wey want economic integration and make im wealth big well, dey see am) and na so de benefit big reach wet person fit get from division of labor.[^1]

True true, de commodity wey dem first choose as de best-cos-most-universal-money na gold. if government nor us force, dem for choose gold again for de near future as de commodity wey dey do de work of money wella. Sef-interset go make every body to like make gold be — de medium of exchange wey dem dey use universally — pass any oda money. To de point wey everybody go dey see dem sef and wetin dem get like sey dem don enter exchange economy, dem ho prefer accounting with gold instead of with any oda money , cos de way everybody accept gold go make dat kind acvounting to be de most complete way wey dem fit show opportunity cost, and so e go serve as de best guide for person wey want expand im wealth. dem go stop to use all oda money dem quick quick, cos anytin wey nor dey up to de money wey everybody dey use, just like gold—weda na national or regional money dem— go contradict de very reason of to get money for de first place. Na man wey get sef-interest wey invent money just so dat im go increase im wealth,as im put im self inside ever-wide and ultimately universal market. As dem dey pursue sef interest, gold go quick win national and regional money dem, cos na only gold dey make economic intergration complete and market dem worldwide, dat way im don do de ultimate work of money as common way to do exchange. [^2]

De emergence of money, better money dem and finally of one universal money, gold, dey free productive energy wey don dey frustrated and idle cos of dem restrict two-coincidence-of-want for de process of exchanges ( just like de existence of money dem wey dey compete with each oda with exchange rate wey dey freely go up and down). for under barter de market of producer output dey restricted for de kind times wen double want happen. As all prices go dey show for gold de producer market dey likely encompassing, and demand dey happen without any absence of any double coincidence to restrict am for world wide scale. Just like dat, production dey increase — and e dey increase wella with gold pass any oda money. As production increase, de value of money dey rise too, and as purchasing power of money go high na so e people wey dey book am go reduce, e go lower effective rate of time preference (de obonge rate of interest) and e dey make capital formation to increase. Se spiraling process of economic development wey dey go upward don dey in motion

Dis development dey create de basis for de emergence of banks as institution dem wey specialise for money-handling. For de oda hand, bank dem dey help to meet de demand wey dey on de rise for safekeeping, transporting and clearing of money. On de oda hand, dem dey fulfil de function wey dey rise of to help do exchange for capitalist (savers) and entrepreneurs (investors), and dem dey also make division of labour wey nearly complete possible for dese two roles dem. As institution dem of deposit and just like saving and credit institution dem, bank dey quick quick become nerve center of economy. As e dey increase, de spatial and temporal allocation and coordination of economic resource dem and activities dey happen cos of de mediation of bank dem; and also to facilitate dis type of coordination de emergence of bank dem means sey na anoda push for economic growth.[^3].

While dis one concern everybody economic interest say make only one universal money and only one unit account dey, and as man dey pursue  wealth maximization im nor go stop until im get am, e nor blend with dat kind interest sey make only on bank dey or one monopolistic banking system. Instead, self-interest dey command say make every bank dey use de same universal money —wey be gold—and make competition nor dey between oda money ddm, but instead make competition dey between bank an banking system dem wey dey use gold. Only if free entry  into bank dey exist wey cost efficiency go dey for dis business or any oda business;  even so, na only as long as dis competition concern services wey dem give for terms of one and de same money commodity wey free banking go fit fulfil de very function of money ad banking, as in, to help economic integration instead of disintegration, to make de market wide and to expand de division of labor instead of to restrict dem, to make value and cost accounting make sense wella instead of small, and so to increase instead of to decrease economic wealth. De tori of competition between money dem na *contradiction in adjecto*. As we dey talk, monetary system with rival money dem of exchange rates wey dey free to go up and down na still system of (partial) barter, with de problem of to need double coincidence dem of want just so dat (some kind) exchanges go happen. De existence of dat kind of system nor dey help de very purpose of money[^4] as e dey pursue im own sef-interest, man go quick quick abandon am—and e go be fundamental misconception as e regard why money dey important to think of de free market for terms competitive money dem nor be only competing banks. Competitive money dem nor be de result of wetin free market do but dem be de result of force, of de obstacle wey government put for de direction of rational economic conduct.

With free banking based on a universal gold standard emerging, the goal of achieving the most cost efficient solution to coordinating and facilitating interspatial and intertemporal exchanges within the framework of a universally integrated market is accomplished. Prices for the service of safekeeping, transporting and clearing money, as well as for advancing money in time-contracts would drop to their lowest possible levels under a regime of free entry. And since these prices would be expressed in terms of one universal money, they would truly reflect the minimum costs of providing market-integrative services.

Moreover, bank competition combined with the fact that money must emerge as a commodity—such as gold—which in addition to its value as money has a commodity value and thus cannot be produced without significant cost-expenditure, also provides the best possible safeguard against fraudulent banking.

As money depositing institutions, banks—much like other institutions depositing fungible commodities yet more so in the case of banks because of the special role of the commodity money—are tempted to issue “fake” warehouse receipts, i.e., notes of deposit not covered by real money, as soon as such banknotes have assumed the role of money substitutes and are treated by market participants as unquestionable equivalents of actually deposited real money. In this situation, by issuing fake or fiat banknotes that physically cannot be distinguished from genuine money substitutes, a bank can—fraudulently and at another’s expense—increase its own wealth. It can directly purchase goods with such fake notes and thus enrich itself in the same way as any simple counterfeiter does. The bank’s real wealth and the wealth of the early recipients of the money increases through these purchases, and at the same time and by the same action the wealth of those receiving the new money late or not at all decreases, due to the inflationary consequences of counterfeiting. Or a bank can use such fiat money to expand its credit and earn interest on it. Once again a fraudulent income and wealth redistribution in the bank’s favor takes place.[^6] Yet in addition, this time a boom-bust cycle is also set in motion: Placed at a lowered interest rate, the newly granted credit causes increased investments and initially creates a boom that cannot be distinguished from an economic expansion; however, this boom must turn bust because the credit that stimulated it does not represent real savings but instead was created out of thin air. Hence, with the entire new and expanded investment structure under way, a lack of capital must arise that makes the successful completion of all investment projects systematically impossible and instead requires a contraction with a liquidation of previous malinvestments.[^7]

Under the gold standard any bank or banking system (including a monopolist one) would be constrained in its own inclination to succumb to such temptations by two requirements essential for successful counterfeiting. On the one hand, the banking public must not be suspicious of the trustworthiness of the bank—that is, its anti-fraud vigilance must be low for otherwise a bank run would quickly reveal the committed fraud. On the other hand, the bank cannot inflate its notes at such a pace that the public loses confidence in the notes’ purchasing power, reduces its reservation demand for them and flees instead towards “real” values, including real money, and thereby drives the counterfeiter into bankruptcy. Under a system of free banking, however, with no legal tender laws and gold as money, an additional constraint on potential bank fraud arises, for then every bank is faced with the existence of nonclients or clients of different banks. If in this situation additional counterfeit money is brought into circulation by a bank, it must invariably reckon with the fact that the money may end up in nonclients’ hands who demand immediate redemption, which the bank then would be unable to grant without at least a painful credit contraction. In fact, such a corrective contraction could only be avoided if the additional fiat money were to go exclusively into the cash reserves of the bank’s own clients and were used by them exclusively for transactions with other clients. Yet since a bank would have no way of knowing whether or not such a specific outcome could be achieved, or how to achieve it, the threat of a following credit contraction would act as an inescapable economic deterrent to any bank fraud.[^8]

[^8]: What about cartels? Could not the competing banks form a cartel and agree on a joint venture in counterfeiting? Again, under free banking this is most unlikely, because a system of free banking is characterized by the complete absence of any economic incentive for cartelization. With no restrictions of entry in existence, any such bank cartel would have to be classified as voluntary and would suffer from the same problems as any voluntary cartel: Faced with the threat of noncartelists and/or new entrants, and recognizing that like all cartel agreements, a banking cartel would favor the less efficient cartel members at the expense of the more efficient ones, there is simply no economic basis for successful action, and any attempt to cartelize would quickly break down as economically inefficient. Moreover, insofar as the counterfeit money would be employed to expand credit, banks acting in concert would set off a full-scale boom-bust cycle. This, too, would deter cartelization.
