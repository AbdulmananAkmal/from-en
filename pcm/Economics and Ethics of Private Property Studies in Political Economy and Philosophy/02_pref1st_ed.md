Weda all dis studies concern ecomic topics like employment, interest, money, banking, business cycles, taes, public goods or even growth sef; with philosophical wahala as foundations of knowledge, and particularly for economic and ethics; or even if na de reconstruction and theoretical explanation of sociological phenomena of things wey hapen long ago like exploitation, de rise and fall of civilizations, international politics, war, imperialism, and eeven de work of ideas and ideological movements during de process of social evolution\---each of dem come dey ultimately contributes to just one conclusion: De right to private property nor be wetin dem dey argue about cos say e valid, and de total principle of ethics wey be de basis for "normal" economic progress to dey continue. To rise from de ruins of socialism and overcome de stagnation of de Western welfare states, notin fit reach pass total privatization of everytin dem socialized before, and dem be, government, property and dem need establish a society wey be like contract wey go dey based on say dem go totally recognized de rights of private property.

As i dey write all dis studies, me get help from may places. Special thanks go to my wife Margaret, who again took on the task of de-Germanizing my English; to Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and to Burton S. Blumert, president of the Center for Libertarian Studies, for their continuing support of my work; and to my friend David Gordon, for his numerous invaluable suggestions and comments.

My largest debt is to Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard, the twentieth centuryâ€™s two greatest-though much neglected-economists and social philosophers. While I never met Ludwig von Mises, and indeed had not heard of his name until after his death, I am fortunate to have been closely associated with Murray Rothbard for the past six years, first in New York City, and since 1986 as colleagues at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Apart from the intellectual debt that I owe him, words cannot express my personal gratitude. His wisdom, insight, kindness, enthusiasm, and unflagging encouragement have been a continuous inspiration to me. It is, therefore, to him that this volume is dedicated.
