#### Interest

Money dey “neutral” also to interest. Howeva, interest, unlike money,dey praxeologically related to employment and social product.

As money na de result of uncertainty, so interest dey result from time preference, wey dey important to action as uncertainty (and for sense go dey explained shortly even more so). For acting, actor nor only dey aim invariably to substitute more for less satisfactory state of affairs and so demonstrates a preference for more rather than less goods; he must invariably also consider wen for future e goals go don actualize (i.e., de time necessary to accomplish dem) as well as  good’s duration of serviceability, and every action as e be so dey also demonstrates a universal preference for earlier over later goods and of more over less durable ones. Every action dey require some time to attain e goal; sinx man gats consume sometin sometimes and no fit stop consuming entirely, time dey always scarce. As e be, *ceteris paribus*, present or earlier goods dey, and must invariably dey, valued more highly dan future or later ones.[^11] In fact, if man nor dey constrained by time preference and de only constraint wey dey operate na that of preferring more over less, he go invariably choose dose production processes wey go yield de largest output per input, regardless of de length of time needed for dese methods to bear fruit. For instance, instead of building a fishing net first, Crusoe go immediately begin construction of fishing trawler, as de economically most efficient method for catching fish. Say no person, including Crusoe, dey act for dis way make am dey clear say man nor fit but “value fractions of time of dd same length in different way according as dem dey nearer or farther from de instant of de actor  decision.”[^12]

So, constrained by time preference, man go only exchange present good  for future one if he anticipate dereby increasing e amount of future goods. De rate of time preference, wey fit dey different from person to person and from one point in time to de next, but wey nor go eva be anytin but positive for everybody , simultaneously go determines de height of de premium wey present goods command over future ones as well as de amount of savings and investment. De market rate of interest na de aggregate sum of all individual time preference rates, reflecting, so to say, de social rate of time preference, and equilibrating social savings (i.e., de supply of present goods wey don dey offered for exchange against future goods) and social investment (i.e., de demand for present goods wey dry capable of yielding future returns).

No supply of loanable funds for fit exist without previous savings, i.e., witout de abstention from some possible consumption of present goods. To continue further, no demand for loanable funds go exist if nobody dey to perceive any opportunity to put present goods productively (i.e., to invest dem so as to produce a future output wey go exceed current input). Truly, if all present goods bin dey consumed and no one dey invested in time-consuming production processes, interest or time preference rate nor go dey, or rada, de interest rate go dey infinitely high, wey outside of the Garden of Eden, go dey tantamount to eking out a primitive subsistence living by encountering reality wit notin but one’s bare hands and wit nothing but a desire for instantaneous gratification.

A supply of and a demand for loanable funds dey only arise—and dis na de human condition—once e don dey recognized say indirect, more roundabout, lengthier production processes fut yield larger or beta output per input dan direct and short ones;[^13] and e dey possible, by means of savings, to accumulate de amount of present goods wey dey needed to provide for all dose wants wey dia satisfaction during de prolonged waiting time dey deemed more urgent dan de increment for future well-being wey dry expected from de adoption of more time-consuming production process.[^14]

So long as dis na de case, capital formation and accumulation go set in and continue. Instead of to dey being supported by and engaged for instantaneously gratifying production processes, de originary factors of production, land and labor, dey supported by excess of production over consumption and put for dr production of capital goods. Dese nor get value except as intermediate products for de process of turning out final (consumer) goods. In oda words, dia value dey lie for de fact say whoeva possesse dem fit use dem to produce oda capital goods more efficiently. De excess for value (price) of a capital good over de sum wey don dey expended for de complementary originary factors required for e production dey due to dis time difference and de universal fact of time preference. Na d price paid for buying time; for moving closer to de completion of person ultimate goal rada dan to go start for de very beginning. Bcos of time preference, de value of de final output gats exceed de sum wey don dey spent for ei factors of production (de price paid for de capital good and all complementary labor services).

De lower de time preference rate, den, de earlier de process of capital formation go set in, and de faster e go lengthen de roundabout structure of production. Any increase for d accumulation of capital goods and for de roundaboutness of de production structure in turn go raise de marginal productivity of labor. Dis go lead to either increased employment and/or wage rates, and, for any case (even if de labor supply curve go become backward sloping wit increased wages), to a higher wage total.[^15] Supplied wit an increased amount of capital goods den, a better paid population of wage earners go produce an overall increased—future—social product, raising at last, afta dat of de employees, also de real incomes of de owners of capital and land. While interest (time preference) as e be get direct praxeological relation to employment and social income, e get notin whatsoeva to do with money. To dey sure, fir money economy dem dey also exist  monetary expression for de social rate of time preference. Yet dis nor change de fact say interest and money dey systematically independent and unrelated, and interest na “real,” nor be monetary phenomenon. In fact, for de neva-neva land of equilibrium place nor go dey for money bcos de future by definition go dey certain and with all uncertainty removed nobody go get any need for cash holdings (wey e sole purpose nai be, cash being neither productive nor consumable, to make person dey prepared for purchases wey e neva know for date wey nor dey known). Time preference and interest, howeva, nor fit dey conceived of as disappearing even den. For even for equilibrium de existing capital structure gats dey constantly maintained over time (so as to prevent am from gradually becoming consumed for de even course of endlessly repeated pattern of productive operations). Dat kind maintenance nor fit dey, howeva, witout ongoing savings and reinvestments: and dere  nor fit dey such tins like dese witout de expectation of positive rate of interest. (Truly, if de rate of interest paid na zero, capital consumption goresult, and person go move out of equilibrium.)[^16]

Matters dey become somehow more complex under conditions wey tins nor dey certain, wit money actually in use, but de praxeological independence of money and interest dey remain fully intact. Under dese conditions, man invariably get three instead of two alternatives as to how to allocate e current income. E gats not only decide how much to allocate to de purchase of present goods and how much to future goods (i.e., how much he wan consume and how much to invest), but also how much to keep for cash. No oda alternatives dey. Yet while man gatsat all times make adjustments concerning three margins at once, invariably de outcome go deydetermined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. De consumption/investment proportion dey determined by time preference. De source of de demand for cash, on de oda hand, na de utility attached to money (i.e., e usefulness to dey allow immediate purchases of directly serviceable goods at uncertain future dates). Both factors fit vary, independent of one anoda.

If de supply of money come change, or if de demand for money change wit one social stock of money, de purchasing power of money go also change. Howeva, aside from causing changes for relative incomes, no such changes for money unit’s purchasing power go get any effect on overall real income. Incomes in terms of money dey increase or decrease, yet de purchasing power of money dey correspondingly fall or rise, leaving real income unchanged. Or, wit money incomes unchanged, more or less of it go dey held for cash (hoarded), but den de purchasing power of money dey correspondingly rise or fall, once again leaving de real income purchased wit a smaller or larger sum of money unaltered. Na dis real income, howeva, nor be money as such, nai man time preference schedule dey related, and in light of which e effective rate of time preference dey determined. Since real income nor dey change thru all dese monetary changes, no reason dey to suppose say de rate of time preference go change. If, for instance, de Keynesian nightmare of increased hoarding come become reality and prices generally fall while de purchasing power of money correspondingly rises, dis go leave de real investment/consumption proportion entirely unaffected. Unless de time preference schedule dey assume to don change at de same time, de additional hoards go dey drawn from funds wey formerly dem dey spend on consumption and from funds wey formerly dey go inside investment for de same pre-established proportion, so as to leave real consumption and real investment for precisely dia old levels. Howeva, if time-preference dey assumed to change concomitantly, den everytin dey possible. Indeed, if de additional hoards ddy come exclusively from previous consumption spending, increased demand for money fit go hand in hand even wit  fall in de rate of interest and increased investment. Yet dis dey due not to changes in de demand for money but exclusively to a change (a fall) for de time preference schedule.[^17]

#### The Capitalist Process

Wit say de division of labor don dey established and extended to e ultimate limit thru de development of a universal medium of exchange, de process of economic development dey essentially determined by time preference.

To dey sure, other factors dey wey dey important: de quality and quantity of de population, de endowment wit nature-given resources, and  de state of technology. Yet among dem, de quality of a people dey largely beyond anybody control and gats dey taken as a given: de quantity of a population may or may not advance economic development, depending on whether de population dey below or above e optimum size for a given-sized territory: and nature-given resources or technological know-how fit get only economic impact if discovered and utilized. To do dis, tho, prior savings and investment gats deh. Nor be de availability of resources and technical or scientific knowledge nai dey impose limits on economic advancement: rada, na time preference nai dey impose limits for de exploitation of actually available resources as well as on de utilization of existing knowledge (and also on scientific progress for dat matter, insofar as research activities, too, must dey supported by saved-up funds).

So, de only viable path toward economic growth na thru savings and investment, governed as dem dey by time preference. Ultimately no way dey toward prosperity except thru increase for de per capita quota of invested capital. Dis na de only way to increase tde marginal productivity of labor and only if dis dey done nai future income fit rise in turn. With real incomes rising, de effective rate of time preference go fall (witout, howeva, eva reaching zero or even becoming negative), adding still further increased doses of investment, and setting in motion upward spiraling process of economic development.

No reason dey to suppose say dis process gats come to a halt short of reaching de Garden of Eden where all scarcity don disappear—unless people deliberately choose odawise and begin to value additional leisure more highly dan any further increase for real incomes. No reason dey even to suppose say de process of capitalist development go be anytin but smooth and dat de economy go flexibly adjust not only to all monetary changes but to all changes for de social rate of time preference as well. Of course, so long as de future dey uncertain, dere go be entrepreneurial errors, losses, and bankruptcies. But no systematic reason dey exist why dis go cause more dan temporary disruptions, or why dese disruptions go exceed, or drastically fluctuate around, a “natural rate” of business failures.[^18]

Matter go become different only if an extra-market institution like government dey introduced. E nironly makes involuntary unemployment possible, as explained above: de very existence of an agency wey fit effectively claim ownership over resources wey e neva homestead, produce, abi contractually acquire, go also raise de social rate of time preference for homesteaders, producers, and contractors, and so create involuntary impoverishment, stagnation, or even regression. Na only thru government nai mankind fit deystopped on e natural course toward  gradual emancipation from scarcity long before even reaching de point of a voluntarily chosen zero-growth.[^19] And na for de presence alone of  government, nai de capitalist process fit possibly take on a cyclical (rada dan  smooth) pattern, wit busts wey dey follow booms. Exempt from the rules of private property acquisition and transfer, government naturally desires a monopoly over money and banking and wants nothing better than to engage in fractional reserve (deposit) banking—in nontechnical terms: monopolistic counterfeiting—so as to enrich itself at the expense of others through the much less conspicuous means of fraud rather than through outright confiscation.[^20] Boom and bust cycles are the outcome of fraudulent fractional reserve banking. If and insofar as the newly created counterfeit money enters the economy as additional supplies on the credit market, the rate of interest will have to fall below what it otherwise would have been. Credit must become cheaper. Yet at a lower price more credit is taken, and more resources then are invested in the production of future goods (instead of being used for present consumption) than otherwise would have been. The roundaboutness of the entire production structure is lengthened. In order to complete all investment projects that now are underway, more time is needed than that required to complete those begun before the credit expansion. All the goods which would have been created without credit expansion must be produced; plus those that are newly added. For this to be possible, however, more capital is required. The larger amount of future goods can only be produced successfully if additional savings provide for a fund of means of sustenance sufficiently large to bridge, and carry workers through, the longer waiting time. But, by assumption, no such increase in savings has taken place. The lower interest rate is not the result of a larger supply of capital goods. The social rate of time preference has not changed at all. It is solely the result of counterfeit money entering the economy through the credit market. It follows logically that it must be considered impossible to successfully complete all investment projects underway after a credit expansion due to a systematic lack of real capital. Projects will have to be liquidated so as to shorten the overall production structure and to readjust it to an unchanged rate of social time preference and the corresponding real investment-consumption proportion.[^21]

These cyclical movements can neither be avoided by expecting them (according to the motto “a cycle anticipated is a cycle avoided”): They are the praxeologically necessary consequence of additional counterfeit credit being successfully placed. Once this is the case, a boom-bust cycle is inevitable, regardless of what actors correctly or incorrectly believe or expect. The cycle is induced by a monetary change, but it takes effect in the realm of “real” phenomena and will be a “real” cycle no matter what beliefs people happen to hold.[^22]

Nor can it be realistically expected that the inevitable cyclical movements resulting from an expansion of credit will ever come to a halt: So long as an extra-market institution like government is in control of money, a permanent series of cyclical movements will mark the process of economic development. For through the creation of fraudulent credit, a government can engender a smooth and highly inconspicuous income and wealth redistribution in its own favor. There is no reason (short of angelic assumptions) to suppose that it would ever deliberately stop using this magic wand merely because credit expansion has the “unfortunate” side-effect of business cycles.
