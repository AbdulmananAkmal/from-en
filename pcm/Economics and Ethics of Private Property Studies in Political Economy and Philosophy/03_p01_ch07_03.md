### De matter wey concern Fraud: Reserve Banking wey dey fractional and de Freedom wey dey inside Contract

De classification wey Murray Rothbard do wey call fractional reserve banking as fake something na de answer wey e get for one long research wey im do wey concern ethics and property-rights theory. Selgin and White talk am correctly say economics no need too much brain and e dey different from ethics. Person fit study am without say e never first learn anything wey be concern property and property-rights theory. Even like dat sef, dem nor been dey waste time to talk some kind ethical statements wey get power well well. If dem wan do like say dem dey good if dem dey defend fractional reserve banking, Selgin and White dey hardly talk of property, talkless to come dey list de theory wey concern  property. Dis one com bring about plenty serious mistake and wahala: confusion com dey dey if dem wan differentiate between property and titles wey property get; wahala wey concern  weda e dey possible or not make one thing (property) get owner wey pass one for de same time; wahala wey concern priority of property wey dey logical and theory wey concern property if dem put am side by side with contract and de theory wey concern contract; and wahala wey still concern if e dey necessary make somebody fulfill everything wey e suppose do  wey dey inside de contract with person property (and e no go be just anybody).

De wahala go come enter wetin de author dey talk for de issue wey concern “freedom of contract.” De tin wey dem dey argue sef just dey straightforward.

> If bank nor put mouth or nor join for de matter wey na to hold reserve 100 percent, den fractional reserve nor go against de agreement wey dey inside de contract between bank and de customers wey dey follow de bank do business. …  If we comot am for law de arrangement wey dey inside contract wey dem no force person to permit reserve-holding go be like wetin person put hand for inside de market, den freedom wey contract get go com get limits and dat freedom na part wey dey very important for private property rights.[^14]

Dis passage go come show us again de ultra-subjectivism wey Selgin and White don first talk before. For wetin this view come talk, na agreement wey dem no dey put force naim dey actually -dey talk- wetin contract wey dey valid be. If we look am dat way, contract wey dey valid na agreement wey concern to dey transfer real property; derefor, de selection of contracts wey dey valid dey always dey first meet problem wey concern de nature of things and property(and later, e go come be only agreement). Na because of dis thing Hoppe (p. 70) com explain am well say

> Freedom of contract nor mean say *all* de contract wey go dey of advantage to me and you, make dem allow am…. Wetin freedom of contract mean be say make dem dey allow A and B to dey make any contract  at all *wey concern property wey na dem get*, but fractional reserve banking go need may dem dey make contracts wey concern properties wey third parties get. [^15]

Selgin and White com talk say dis tin wey dem talk, e nor correct  and dem come call am “third- party effects” and dem come challenge wetin Hoppe talk with confusion wey strong well well wey concern the nature wey property and property rights get. Wetin dem first talk come be

> wetin remain for other actions and de *quality* of property wey dey under C… na somtin wey dem nor fit escape for free-market and nor be say e dey go against the private-property rights wey C get,[and for another way] *say dem use force tey enter* C property… and e clear say e nor follow wetin the right wey dey protect C property talk. E suppose dey clear say if dem tell A and B may dem do any transaction wey even get small effect for de *market value* of wetin C get, without any power wey dem dey show or threat wey nor go favour C or de property wey C get, then de law wey dem tey choose private property, freedom wey suppose dey inside contract and completion wey go get free-market go come comot patapata. Dem nor suppose to allow B make e tell A say e wan sell compact disc recording, because say if e sell am, e go come reduce de value wey de place wey dem dey record  vinyl wey be C own?[^16]

De second one, dem com talk say if you reduce de power wey money get to tey buy something, wey dem agree say go occur for every matter wey concern fiduciary media, say de value-effect nor go get harm and derefor “e nor go provide any reason wey dem go tey stop de action wey bank wan take for court.” Derefore dem come reach conclusion wey be say dem talk say Hoppe argument “nor dey valid” (and dem nor fit join am with the theory wey Rothbard talk wey concern property).

De argument wey Selgie and White bin dey argue com get two mistake. De first one be say, de main tin wey dem first talk bin correct, na lie say Hoppe dey mistake for wetin dem talk. Hoppe don write well well for de theory wey concern property rights, and e nor dey aware for only de tin wey com stand out wey Selgin and White talk but e com even bring defense wey dey practical for wetin dem talk; derefore for dis matter, difference nor dey for de judgement wey Rothbard and Hoppe talk.[^17]

For De second one, de small tin wey dem be talk before na lie (and even wetin dem conclude too go be lie). Selgin and White talk say if de power to tey buy com fall because of fiduciary media na de same tin as say price of anything wey don fall and wey nor dey coz harm (wey change of supply and demand coz). Say people wey get money dey lose power to tey buy na because of de reserve banking wey dey fractional, as dem dey claim, e nor different for all dose people wey get potato or car dey suffer for value loss because of say de supply many or people wey dey need am com reduce for potato and motor.

For dis place again, Selgin and White com dey bring money (gold) together – na im be property, and all dose things wey fit replace money (banknotes) – na im be property titles. To dey sure, de matter wey concern fiduciary media nor dey lead to damage wey we fit see for physical property. After all, banknote na just piece of paper, and paper nor dey get effect for de outside world. But we fit talk de same thing for de mata wey concern fiduciary titles wey affect potato and motor. All dose one too na just pieces of paper, and e nor get effect for real world. Even tho, e still get one difference wey dey important wey dey between changes for de position of money wey who get potato and motor get wey change for demand and to dey supply for titles wey quantities wey nor dey exist ( e nor dey change) of motor and potato get for de other hand. Na sure thing be say people wey get potato and motor go dey affected for de two case. For the first case, if de money for potato or motor com fall because people wey dey buy de potato and motor com get supply wey com too many, everybody wey still get potato and motor go still get de same (e nor go change) amount of wetin im get (motor and potato) wey dey e hand. None of wetin dem get go reduce. Na de same tin if de price com fall because say people wey dey buy de potato or motor dey willing to only bring out small amount of de other  things wey dem get to tey exchange for de motor and potato, dis one by eself nor get any effect for de quantity of potato wey who get potato com get or de quantity of motor wey who dey sell motor get. If we wan differentiate wetin we talk for de second case, to dey give and sell another title to de quantity of potato and motor wey nor change *go* com cause make de quantity of potato and motor wey dere owners get to come less. E nor just get any value-effect; de power to tey buy wey potato or motor title get go come fall. E nor get any physical effect: de person wey dey issue am and de seller of fudiciary potato or motor titles go com dey use other people potato and motor anyhow. He go come dey give out other people property and e nor go gree release e own (to tey exchange for property title wey dey empty).[^18]

### The Issue of Fraud III: The "Proof from Existence" Fractional Reserve Banking and State

Neither the title-transfer theory of contract nor the principle of freedom of contract supports the claim that the issue of fiduciary media and fractional reserve banking is ethically justified. To the contrary, only one other argument remains in support of the claim that fractional reserve banking represents a legitimate form of business.

The argument boils down to a proof from existence: X, Y, or Z exists; it would not exist if it were not beneficial; hence, it should exist (and outlawing it would be detrimental and morally wrong).

Thus, write Selgin and White:

> the group [of people] whose freedom of contract we are concerned with here is not a small eccentric bunch, but is the great mass of people who have demonstrated that they do prefer banks that operate on fractional reserves…. Depositors continue to patronize these banks, demonstrating their preference, for them.[^19]
> 
> … By the principle of demonstrated preference depositors must be presumed to benefit from the package they have agreed to accept, risk and all.[^20]
> 
> \[Consequently,\] \[if\] *any* person knowingly prefers to put money into an (interest-bearing) fractional-reserve account, rather than into a (storage-fee-charging) 100 percent reserve account, then a blanket prohibition on fractional-reserve banking by force of law is a binding legal restriction on freedom of contact in the market for banking services.[^21]
> 
> [Moreover,] … [b]enefits accrue to bank depositors and noteholders, who receive interest and services paid for by the extra bank revenue generated from lending out a portion of its liabilities. Benefits accrue to bank borrowers who enjoy a more ample supply of intermediated credit, and to everyone who works with the economy’s consequently larger stock of capital equipment. And benefits must accrue to bank shareholders, who could choose to have the bank not issue demand liabilities if they found the risks not worth bearing.[^22]

Selgin and White have here put the cart before the horse. The existence of a practice, however widespread, has no bearing on the question of whether it is justifiable or not. Consider first, for illustrative purposes, the following analogy concerning the ethical permissibility of a state, that is, of a territorial monopolist of law and order (or of justice and protection).[^23]

In the words of Selgin and White (applied here in a different context and paraphrased), the group of people whose freedom of contract we are concerned with is not a small eccentric bunch, but is the great mass of people who have demonstrated that they do prefer states (judges and protectors) that operate on a monopolistic basis. Territorial inhabitants continue to patronize these states, demonstrating their preference for them. By the principle of demonstrated preference, territorial inhabitants must be presumed to benefit from the package they have agreed to accept, risk and all. Consequently, if any person knowingly prefers to put money into a tax-bearing state account, rather than into a protection-fee-charging account in nontaxing justice and protection agencies, then a blanket prohibition on state-formation by force of law is a binding legal restriction on freedom of contract in the market for justice and protection services. Moreover, benefits accrue to state depositors and noteholders, who receive interest and services paid for by the extra state revenue generated from employing parts of the deposits for extra tax collections. Benefits accrue to state borrowers who enjoy a more ample supply of intermediated credit, and to everyone who works with the economy’s consequently larger stock of capital equipment. And benefits must accrue to state shareholders, who could choose to have the state not engage in taxation if they found the risks not worth taking.

Given their own libertarian credentials, Selgin and White would presumably reject this analogy as false and inappropriate. But if so, why? What is it that invalidates the second *proof*, but not the first? What if anything, makes a blanket prohibition (or permission) of fractional reserve banking categorically different from a blanket prohibition (or permission) of state formation and operation?

The answer—that no such difference exists and that both proofs are equally invalid—is to be found in the Rothbardian principle of demonstrated preference. While Selgin and White invoke this principle in support of their conclusion regarding the ethical permissibility of fractional reserve banking, they miss its implication. The principle of demonstrated preference, as explained by Rothbard in his celebrated “Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics,” *presupposes* property rights. Not all demonstrated preferences are ethically permissible or socially beneficial. Instead, the only such preferences that are permissible and welfare enhancing are these that are expressed by means of one’s own property and nothing but one’s own property. Every preference demonstration by means of property other than one’s own—with other people’s property—is impermissible and nonbeneficial.

As for the demonstrated preference for states, it runs afoul of Rothbard’s principle. In Rothbard’s analysis, which is presumably accepted by the participants on both sides of the current debate, the violation can be quickly pinpointed. Private property, as the result of acts of (original) appropriation and/or production, implies the owner’s right to exclusive jurisdiction regarding his property, including the right to employ this property in defense against possible invasions and invaders. Indeed, there can be no property without an owner’s right to physical defense, and it is the very purpose of private property to establish separate domains of exclusive jurisdiction. No private-property owner can possibly surrender his right to ultimate jurisdiction over and defense of his property to someone else—unless he sells or otherwise transfers his property (in which case someone else would have exclusive jurisdiction over it). That is, so long as something (a good) has not been abandoned, its owner must be presumed as retaining these rights; and as far as his relations to others are concerned, every property owner may then only partake in the advantages of the division of labor and seek better and improved protection of his unalterable property rights through cooperation with other owners of property. Every property owner can buy from, sell to, or otherwise contract with everyone else concerning supplemental property protection and security services. Yet each owner also may at any time unilaterally discontinue any such cooperation with others. In distinct contrast, a territorial monopoly of protection and jurisdiction—a state—implies that every property owner is prohibited from discontinuing his cooperation with his protector, and that no one (except the monopolist) may exercise ultimate jurisdiction over his own property. Rather, everyone except the monopolist has lost his right to defense and is thus rendered defenseless vis-à-vis his own protector. Obviously, such an institution stands in contradiction to every owner’s demonstrated preference of not giving up his property. Contrary to their demonstrated preference, the monopolist prohibits the people from using their property in physical defense against possible invasions by himself and his agents. A monopoly of protection and jurisdiction rests thus from the outset on an impermissible act of expropriation (taxation) and provides the monopolist and his agents with a license to further expropriation and taxation. Every owner’s range of permissible actions regarding his own property, and hence the value of his property, is diminished, whereas the monopolist’s range of action and control is correspondingly enlarged and his exclusive privilege is reflected in an increase in the value of his property (capitalization of monopoly profit).

Presently, states exist everywhere, and almost everyone resides under state *protection*. Regardless of this preference demonstration, however, there is nothing wrong, ethically or economically, with blanket protection against state formation. No one may form a state, for the same reason that no one may expropriate or rob anyone else. In a court of law, it would be sufficient that a single property owner objected to the monopoly’s existence, and the monopolist would have to cease in his current operation as a tax-yielding protection agency and be repaired to the legal status of a nontaxing but fee-charging law-and-security agency (a normal specialized firm). A tax-yielding protection agency is a contradiction in terms—an invasive protector—and must be forbidden, irrespective of any benefits accruing to state depositors, state borrowers, and state owners. To do so is not a legal restriction on freedom of contract in the market for justice and protection services, but the very presupposition of freedom of contract and justice. Everyone putting money or any other resources into a tax-yielding protection account is engaged in unlawful action and subject to punishment.

Just as states exist everywhere, so do fractional reserve banks, and nowadays practically everyone is banking with fractional reserve banks. What, if anything, is the difference between the status of a state and that of a fractional reserve bank? Why should fractional reserve banks not be outlaw banks just as states outlaw protection agencies? To be sure, just as there can be no doubt concerning a demand for protection services, there can also be no doubt as to a demand for banking services. Yet the demand for protection services that private property owners may properly demonstrate does not include a demand for tax-yielding protection services, as we have seen. It exclusively permits a demand for fee-charging protection agencies. Why should an analogous distinction not be true also for banking services? Why should a demand for interest-yielding demand deposit accounts not be just as impermissible as the demand for tax-yielding protection accounts, on the ground that both interest-yielding deposit accounts and tax-yielding property protection are contradictions in terms? Why should the functions of a money warehouser and clearing institution (100-percent-reserve-deposit banking) and as an intermediary of credit (savings-and-loan banking) not be the only just forms of banking (just as fee-charging protection agencies are the only legitimate form of protection)?

[^23]: To avoid any misunderstanding, the term monopoly is employed here in its Rothbardian definition as an exclusive privilege (or the absence of free entry). A monopoly of law and order means that one may turn for justice and protection only to one party—the state—and that it is exclusively this party that determines the content of justice and protection.
