Second, dem must to systematically encourage de use of money substitute instead of gold, dem must use de enactment of legal tender law take back up de tendency. De counterfeiting process nor go come cost too much. Instead of to remint gold, na papee ticket dem go print.

Howeva, de problem wey we don talk about beofre stilk dey. As long as de system of free banking still dey operate, dem nor go fit stop de counteefeit note dem to return to new issuer with de request for redemption, and im sef nor go fit— at least nor be without contractive adjustment— do de thing im suppose do. To over dis thing wey block road so, for de next step de state must to monopolize de banking system or use force do turn de banks wey dey compete to carter for under de teaching of im own state-operated central bank. Once e don dey for de command of monopolized or cartelized banking system, de state go fit put de coordinated and joint counterfeit process of de whole banking system for effect so dat im go fit avoid dis risk.

For de next step gold must to be nationalized, as in, de state must to ask all bank dem to deposit dia gokd for de central bank and do dia business with money substitute instead of gold. Dis way gold gi disappear from de market as wetin dem dey use do exchange and instead every day transaction go begin use central banknotes.

 Last last, as gold don comot go enter de hand of de state, de state must to cut all tie to gold, as im go refuse to do wetin im suppose do den come declare say im note nor dey redeemable. As dem build for where gold don leave waka, wey ask na commodity money standar wey im be, been don make am possible make paper note fit buy anythin, pure Fiat money standard don stand straight  and now dem fit use am for operation, for long time, to give de state de unlimited counterfeiting powee wey im don dey compete for.

De goal wey one complete counterfeiting autonomy get dey also dictate de strategy wey dem must pursue for de psychological front. As e clear reach  as e dey approach im ultimate goal de statw dey create victim dem and so e dey in need  of public opinion wey go favour am. im rise to confam counterfeiting power must to dey accompanied with redistributive measure dem wey generate de support wey det necessary to overcome all de forces of resistance wey dey come. E must find  people wey go support am.

As e regard de monopolization of law and ordee of de state, traffic, communication and education and de democratization of im organizational structure — while e dey clear say na redistributive measures wey dem be and so e mean say to fovour one person at de expense of anoda—  e nor dey easy, if e nor even dey impossible to identify de gainers dem and de loser with social classes dem: gainers (or losers) fit dey for different classes: for inside one social class gainers and losers fit dey; and de pattern wey redistribution dey take happen fit shift over time. For all of dis casses dem de link wey dey between de state redistributive expenditure dem and dia payoffs nor dey direct: weda or not some kind education expenditures, for instance, bring beta oay for term of increased state income go only dey visible afta; and even den e go dey hard to say cos of one definite cause wey  happen. For de case of de monopolization of money and banking, for de oda hand, which person for outside de apparatus of de state im sef go follow benefit for im redistributive policy dem and who wey dem clear de loser at once; and sociologically and de benefactor dem go dey easily identified with some kind social class. for dis case de connection wet dey between de state to give redistributive favour and enrich im sef dey direct and close-circuited; and de attribution of causes dey clear to see: De state dey compelled to make bank dem and social class of banker dem im accomplice, as e allow dem to participate inside im counterfeiting operations and so dem enrich dem dia sef with de state own enrichment.

Bankers go be de first people wey go dey aware of dey attempts wey state get for counterfeiting. Without special incentives for de contrary dem nor go get any reason why dem go support dat kin action and any reason wey dem go  fit use uncover and stop dem quick quick. And de state nor go run enter any kind of opposition here: bankers, bcus dem dey high position for deir economic life and bcus of deir far-reaching interconnectedness as professional group wey result from de nature of deir business as facilitators of interspatial and intertemporal exchanges, fit be de most formidable opposition wey person fit encounter. De incentive wey dey necessary to turn dat kin potential enemies to natural allies na de state offer say dem go turn dem to deir own fraudulent machinations. Familiar with de ideas wey dey counterfeiting and e great potential for person enrichment, but knowing, too, say change to engage am nor dey witout say e go run into immediate risk of bankruptcy under free, competitive banking and gold standard, bankers dey always face temptation wey  dem no fit resist. If person wan follow de state’s policy of monopolizing money and banking cum mean say person dey fulfill e dream of getting rich fast. Nor be only de state fit cum into e own once pure fiat money standard don dey established. Provided say dem accord dem de privilege by dr state say make dem counterfeit add to deir own counterfeited note wey dey under monetary regime wey dey less than 100-percent-reserve banking, wey de central bank dey function  as de last resort counterfeiter banks fit dey easy persuaded make dem regard de establishment of dat kind monetary system as dia ultimate goal and as  universal panacea.[^16]

Economically, dis kind coalition wey dey between de state—as de dominant partner—and de banking system—as dia affiliate— go lead to permanent inflation (wey be say the only thing  wey hold dem na make dem  nor over do am so dat de entire monetary system no go breakdown), so dat credit expansion and steadily recurring boom-bust cycles go dey, and to a smooth uninterrupted income and wealth redistribution so dat de state and de bank go dey favoured.

Wetin dey more important pass, na de sociological implications wey dey for dis alliance: as dem form am, a ruling class wey e interest dey tied well well with de state go dey established inside de civil society. Through dia cooperation de state go fit carry e force power reach every area wey dey de society.

Before dem establish de state-banking-alliance, de sociological  separation wey dey  between de state and de society, as in, between de class wey dey exploit people and de class wey dem dey exploit, de almost complete and e dey clearly visible. Here na civil society wey dey produce all de economic wealth; and dere na de state and deir representative wey dey draw parasitically on top wetin odas don produce. People fit be member of either de civil society or de state and dem dey make sure say deir own interests dey connected wit either de former or de latter. If we wan dey sure, redistributive activities dey go on wey favour some part of de society while odas no go dey favoured and e dey divert interest to pursue economic integration to dey one wey dey support exploitation. Upon dat, social corruption dey unsystematic for dis stage. Nor be corruption of social classes dey connected society-wide, but na de corruption of disparate and dispersed individuals abi groups. And dis interests only dey connected to dose of de state wey dey weak thru specific redistributive state activities, instead of thru direct cash-connection.

As dem come form state-banking alliance, all dis go bcum different. Cash-connection between some part of de civil society and de state go exist - and notin dey bring people togeda wey pass joint financial interests. Morever, dis kin connection dey happen between de state  and de tin wey we nor fit identify as closely interconnected class, but as one of de class wey dey influencial and powerful. In fact, nor be only de bank join interest wit de state on dia policy of exploitation. De major clients of de bank, de business establishment and de leaders wey de industry don become deeply integrated for de state counterfeiting schemes, too. Becos apart from de state and banks, na dem be de earliest receivers of de counterfeit money wey dem dey create regularly.  If dem receive am gradually before e ripple thru de economic system, and e go change de relative prices cum even increase the overall price level, and if dem receive credit for fraudulently lower interest rate, dem too dey enrich demsef at de expense of all savers and oda recipients abi nonrecipient of dis money.[^17]

Moreova, dis financial coalition wey dey between industrial  establishment, banks, and de state dey reinforced by each successive course of events. De credit expansion dey lead to increase for investment and - since e nor dey covered by increase for genuine savings - e go lead to corrective contraction. To avoid losses abi bankruptcy de bank customer go approach de banking system so dat e go demand increase for liquitiy (as in, money). Naturally, if bank wan avoid losses, dem dey eager to help dia clients out - and de dem dey do am, dey more dem go dey established as clients. If dem nor fit do dis on deir own, dem go turn to de state and e central bank. And de state, go get opportunity for him own enrichment, e go accept and even provide de banking system, and de business establishment, wit de liquidity wey dem need thru new round of counterfeiting. De alliance go cum dey renewed, and de state don confirm him dominant role again as e don save de established banking and industrial elite so dat dem nor go crumble for de face of economic competition so dat dem go preserve deir status quo abi even increase de wealth wey don already plenty for dia hand. Reason don dey to be thankful and even reciprocate wit invigorated public support for de state and dia propaganda.

To be sure, dis coalition wey dey between de state and de economic power elite nor mean complete identity of interest. De different establish industrial enterprises fit get different abi contrary interest: and de same na tru for banks. Similarly, de interest of banks and business clients fit different in many respects. And nor be say de interest of industrial elites abi de bank coincide togeda wit state own. Becos after all, banks togeda wit business enterprises also dey inside de normal business of making money thru production and productive exchanges - whatever oda sources of income wey dey available to dem. And inside dis function, deir interest fit clash wit de desire of de state for taxes, for example. Upon dat, de establishment of system of monopolized money and banking go still create one interest wey dey common to all of dem: interest wey dey for de preservation of de apparatus of de state and de institution of political (as in, exploitative) means wey dem go take appropriate income like dat. Not only could the state and its central bank destroy any commercial bank and, indirectly, practically any industrial enterprise; this threat is more severe the more established a business is. The state could also help any and all of them get richer, and more so if they are already rich. Hence, the more there is to lose from opposition and to gain from compliance, the more intensive will be the attempts by the economic power elite to infiltrate the state apparatus and have the state leaders assume financial interests in the business world. Bankers and industrialists become politicians; and politicians take positions in banking and industry. A social system emerges and is increasingly characteristic of the modern world in which the state and a closely associated class of banking and business leaders exploit everyone else.[^18][^19]

::::The descriptive part of Marxist analyses is generally valuable. In unearthing the close personal and financial links between state and business, they usually paint a much more realistic picture of the present economic order than do the mostly starry-eyed “bourgeois economists.” Analytically, however, they get almost everything wrong and turn the truth upside down.

::::The traditional, correct pre-Marxist view on exploitation was that of radical laissez-faire liberalism as espoused by, for instance, Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer. According to them, antagonistic interests do not exist between capitalists as owners of factors of production and laborers, but between, on the one hand, the producers in society, i.e., homesteaders, producers and contractors, including businessmen as *well* as workers, and on the other hand, those who acquire wealth nonproductively and/or noncontractually, i.e., the state and stateprivileged groups, such as feudal landlords. This distinction was first confused by Saint-Simon, who had at some time been influenced by Comte and Dunoyer, and who classified market businessmen along with feudal lords and other stateprivileged groups as exploiters. Marx took up this confusion from Saint-Simon and compounded it by making only capitalists exploiters and all workers exploited, justifying this view through a Ricardian labor theory of value and his theory of surplus value. Essentially, this view on exploitation has remained typical for Marxism to this day despite Böhm-Bawerk’s smashing refutation of Marx’s exploitation theory and his explanation of the difference between factor prices and output prices through time preference (interest). To this day, whenever Marxist theorists talk about the exploitative character of monopoly capitalism, they see the root cause of this in the continued existence of the private ownership of means of production. Even if they admit a certain degree of independence of the state apparatus from the class of monopoly capitalists (as in the version of “state monopoly capitalism”), for them it is not the state that makes capitalist exploitation possible; rather it is the fact that the state is an agency of capitalism, an organization that transforms the narrow-minded interests of individual capitalists into the interest of an ideal universal capitalist (the *ideelle Gesamtkapitalist*), which explains the existence of exploitation.

::::In fact, as explained, the truth is precisely the opposite: It is the state that by its very nature is an exploitative organization, and capitalists can engage in exploitation only insofar as they stop being capitalists and instead join forces with the state. Rather than speaking of state monopoly capitalism, then, it would be more appropriate to call the present system “state financed monopoly socialism,” or “bourgeois socialism.”

[^19]: To recognize the far-reaching integration of state interests and those of the economic power elite, which is brought about by the monopolization of money and banking, is not to say that there cannot be conflicts arising within this coalition. As mentioned earlier, the state is also characterized, for instance, by the necessity of democratizing its constitution. And the democratic process could well bring egalitarian or populist sentiments to the surface which were opposed to the state’s favorable treatment of banks and big business. However, it is precisely the financial nature of the state-business connection that makes such an occurrence unlikely. For not only would this pose an immediate threat to the economic power elite; it would also imply severe financial losses in state income, even if it did not threaten the stability of the state as such. Hence a powerful incentive exists for both sides to join forces in filtering any such sentiment out of the political process before it ever becomes widely heard and to ensure with all resources at their command that the range of political alternatives admitted to public discussion is so restricted as to systematically exclude any scrutinizing of their joint counterfeiting racket.
