## Paralelas

Antes de la Revolución Científica, se consideraba inconcebible que el mundo natural pudiera sustentarse a sí mismo sin una entidad consciente y "moral" en su centro. El sol se levantó arrastrando las cadenas de un carro sobrenatural; la luna era un frío y solitario hermano del sol. Las constelaciones delinearon los cuentos y las tumbas de los dioses, y las tormentas se derivaron de la ira de los demonios.

La idea de que la naturaleza era un sistema autogenerado y autosostenible era casi inimaginable. La revolución Darwiniana, la idea de que la vida no se creó, sino que evolucionó, llevó esta idea del mundo material al biológico.

Antes de la ciencia, en el centro de cada sistema complejo yacía una conciencia virtuosa, sin la cual este sistema volaría al caos y dejaría de existir.

Desafortunadamente, esta "conciencia virtuosa" no era más que una ilusión, para decirlo de manera más caritativa. No existían tales dioses; todo lo que * existió * fueron los pronunciamientos de los sacerdotes. Por lo tanto, lo que realmente estaba en el centro era la parcialidad de los individuos irracionales, que no tenían idea de lo enojados que realmente estaban.

Todavía tenemos que aplicar esta misma iluminación a nuestras concepciones de la sociedad, pero ahora es * esencial * que lo hagamos.

Consideramos esencial que, en el centro de la sociedad, coloquemos una entidad virtuosa llamada "el gobierno". En ausencia de esta entidad, consideramos axiomático que la sociedad volará hacia el caos y dejará de ser, así como nuestros antepasados consideró que, en ausencia de dioses, el universo mismo volaría hacia el caos y dejaría de existir.

Sin embargo, "el gobierno" no existe más que "dios" existe.

Cuando hablamos de "dioses", realmente estamos hablando de "las opiniones de los sacerdotes"

Cuando hablamos de "el gobierno", * realmente * significa "la violencia de una pequeña minoría"

The idea of “spontaneous order,” which is well proven in the realms of physics and biology, remains largely inconceivable to us in the realm of society.

However, “governments” are no more needed for the organisation and continuance of society than “gods” are required for the organisation and continuance of the universe.

In fact, just as religions impeded the progress of science, so do governments impede the progress of society. Just as the illusions of *religion* caused the deaths of hundreds of millions of people throughout history, so have the illusions of *government*.

Just as the false ethics of religions “justify” all manners of abuse, corruption and violence, so do the false ethics of governments. When we choose to live by fantasy, we inevitably choose destruction, in one form or another.

When we choose to run society according to religious moral mythologies, we end up with wars, violence, repression, abuse, corruption and bottomless hypocrisy.

When we choose to run society according to *statist* moral mythologies, the results are no different.

We can either choose virtue or compulsion.

We cannot have both.

### Solutions

We can choose to believe that the government is both a necessary and a moral institution. We can choose to believe that, without government, society will collapse into “anarchy,” and the world will dissolve into a war of all against all. We can choose to believe that without the government, there will be no roads, no education, no healthcare, no old-age pensions, no libraries, no protection of property and so on.

Similar superstitions, of course, have retarded the progress of mankind throughout history. The most significant precursor to what UPB reveals about the government is what science revealed about religion.

As science began to practically postulate a universe that could run without a god, all manner of hysterics clamoured that the end of the world was nigh, that society would collapse into “anarchy,” and that civilisation would dissolve into a war of all against all.

Any time a system that justifies power can be conceived of running *without* that power, all those who profit from the manipulation of that power cry out that without them, all is lost.

Priests did this during the onset of the scientific revolution. Without God, life has no meaning. Without God, man has no morality. Without God, our souls cannot be saved. Without God, the world will descend into chaos and evil.

None of it turned out to be true, of course. In fact, quite the *reverse* turned out to be true. The end of religion as the dominant world-view paved the way for the separation of church and state, the end of the aristocracy, the rise of the free market, the establishment of many human liberties in significant areas of the world.

The fall of God was the rise of mankind.

In the same way, when we begin see society as the early scientists saw the universe – as a self-sustaining system without the need for an imaginary central authority – then we can truly begin to perceive the possibilities of freedom for mankind.

The establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in society perpetually retards the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, of virtue, of physical and mental health – just as the establishment of a central and coercive monopoly in the *universe* perpetually retarded the progress of knowledge, of wisdom, and science.

The way to oppose imaginary entities is with relentless truth. The way to oppose God is with reason, evidence and science.

The way to oppose the state – the most dangerous imaginary entity – is with reason, evidence and science.

### The Future

Whether we like it or not, UPB applies to everything that we do. Human beings have a natural tendency towards consistency, since we are beings with a rational consciousness, inhabiting a consistent and rational universe. Thus whatever premises we accept in our lives tend to compel more and more consistent behaviour throughout our lives – and throughout the “life” of our culture or nation as well.

Thus a man who believes that bullying is a good way to get what he wants tends to bully more and more over the course of his lifetime. A man who believes that violence is good tends to become more and more violent.

In other words, UPB demands consistency even in inconsistency. UPB demands uniformity even in immorality.

The root moral premises of a culture thus dictate its inevitable future. A culture built on justifications for coercion will always become more coercive. A culture built on rational liberty will always become less coercive.

That is why the delineation of a rational framework for ethics is so essential.

What we believe is what we become.

If we believe lies, we shall become slaves.
