## Yanayin Tsarin Da’a

Shawarwarin da’a daban suke da sauran ilimin bayanai. Idan nace, “ina son jazz,” wannan bayanin zai iya zama gaskiya ko karya, amma da yawa ba zai zamo laifi a gareka ba ta ko wane hanya. Fifiko na jazz bayani ne akan abun da nake so; akan abun da nace, ba tilas bane ace sai kaso jazz ko kaki jazz.

Haka kuma, idan nace “ina son ganye,” wannan ma bayani ne daya shafe abun da ni nake so. Amma, idan nace, “ganye abu ne mai kara lafiya,” wannan ya tashi daga bayani na zuwa bayani na hakika. Wannan shine bambam ci tsakanin “Ina son ayis kirim” da ayis kirim akwai madara.”

Muhimman hakkokin dake tsakanin bayani na “fifiko” da bayani na “gaskiya” shine bayanin gaskiya hakika ne, an jaraba kuma an daure. Idan kai ma’abocin gaskiya ne, ya zama tilas a gareka ka yarda akwai madara a cikin ayis kirim, da zaran an tabbatar da hakan.[^1]

Idan nace duniya kaman kollo ne, sannan na kawo kararan hujjoji, wannan ya tashi daga abun da zakayi amfani da ilimin kafinka yarda gaskiya ne. idan har zan iya tabbatar da cewa duniya kamar kollo ne, ya zama dole ka yarda gaskiya ne, sai dai idan ya kasan ce baka bukatar dalili da hujjoji  wurin tantance gaskiya.

Idan na yarda da gaskiyan dokokin shari’a lissafi, ba zaiyu ace naki yarda da gaskiya da aka samu ta wannan dokokin. Idan naki yarda da gaskiyan, ba zaiyu naci gaba da ikirarin yarda da dokokin lissafi ba. Yarda na da wa’innan gaskiyan na nufin na daure kai na da dokokin wannan shari’a. kin yarda da hujjojin da kowa ya yarda dasu masu ma’ana kin yarda da dukkan abun da aka yarda dashi mai ma’ana gaba daya ne.

### Sharuddan Gaskiya 

Ilimi na gaskiya shine fahiimtar cewa yanayi na gfaskiya ba da yake da yanayin kasan cewar dutse ko bishiyoyi ba.

Ra’ayin “gaskiya” abun da ya shafi lokaci- duk da yake baya nufin ishara ko sabanin lokaci. Ra’ayin  “lafiya” shima ya shafi lokaci- idan muka hada “lafiya” da ciwo, sannan muka danganta shi da cikakiyar lafiya. Abun lura shine “koshin lafiya” na dan tsawon shekara casa’in ba daya bane da na dan tsawon shekara ashirin. Bayani akan ddadewa a duniya a yanzu daban yake shakara darii biyaar da suka wucce.

Wannan baya nufin, koda yake,   ra’ayin “lafiya” na nufin danganta ka ko ishara. Dan shekara goma maaii famaa da cutar sankarar bargo bashi da lafiya kwata-kwata ba- kamar yanda dan tseren gudu dan shekara ashirin keda lafiya. A yanzun, duk wan   Wanda yakai shekara casa’in a zahirce ya dade, koda yake hakan na iya canza wa idan haanyar kimiya ta lafiya ta samar da hanyar da zamu iya kai shekara dar biyu.

Kamar yanda bayanin “lafiya” ke rarrabewa, bai kauda tsofaffin bayanai, amma yana Kara buda su. Idan hanyoyin cigaba na kimiyar lafiya na iya sa dan shekara casa’in yaci gasar gudu, sannan bayanin mu na lafiya zai iya canza wa- amma baya nufin dan shekara ashirin bashi da lafiya. Koyan aljabara baya gushe lissafi.

Gaskiya nada kima dangaane da muhimmanccin tane. Kimiyar lissafi na Newtonian ya samu daurin gindi daga kimiyar lissafi na einsteiniaan, wanda ya kawo hujjoji masu ma’ana sosai kamar abun mamakin karfin nauyi ko gudu. Koda yake, masu tukin jirgin ruwa wurin lissafin hanyar da tafi inganci a cikin ruwa sunfi samun natsuwa da lissafin kimiyar Newtonian. Ba zaka so tura jiirrgiin sarari zuwa alpha centauri kana amfani da kimiyar lissafi na Newtonian ba, aammaa ba mattsala idan jirgin zai  taasshi  daga lisbon zuwa  new York ne. wahhalaar da akke bukata wuriin kkoya da amfani daa  kimiyar lissafi na Einsteiniaan na da sakamako mara kyau ga masu tukkiin jirgin ruwa.

Saboda wannan sakamakon ne, jimlar “kimiyar lissafi Newtonian nada kura-kurai fiye da kimiyar lissafi na Einsteiniaan, amma kimiyar lissafi Newtonian yafi inganci wurin lissafin hanyar jirgin ruwa” za’a iiya cewaa wannan zabi me kyyaau.  Kimiyar lissafi Newtonian naada *karancii daidaittuwa* da *muhimmancii matuka*.

Idan muna son shan ruwan da yafi inganci, zai zamo zamu biya a kalla dala dduubu akan kowane kolba. Sai dai idan muna da mmahaukatan kkudade da lalata, ba zamu iya biyan wannan kudi ba don kashe kishin mu. Da gaske ne tsaftaccen ruwa yafi mana, amma kudin da tsaftaccen ke bukata yaa wuce misaali, dduk da “tafttaa yafi” yabbaa “tsafta matssallaa” ne wuri.

Duk da haka, wannan baya nufin tsafttaccen ruwa ya zammaa zzabi ne. ruwan kaso yafi ruwan rafi.

#### Gaskiya da hakikan gaskiya

Ra’ayin *gaskiya* na bukatar abun daya shafi ra’ayin *daidai ne*. Idan ina kokarin harbin rikakken Saniya a ido, daidaituwan harbi nna ya danganci nisan da mashi na zai iya kaiwa daga tsakiyar.

Don hakka mennenee idon-sanniyyarr na gaskiya?

*Gaskiyan* bayanin zaa’a auna shine ddanganee da nutsuwan shi daga hakikan gaskiya.

Ajiye matsalolin yare a gefe a yanzun, idan nayi ishara da tsintsun seagull ina cewa, “wancan makera ne,” karara nayi kuskure, saboda makera inorganic ne, kuma basa tashi. Gaskiya wannan bayanin nawa zaa gwada shi dangane da hakikanin gaskiyan lamarin. Tunda tsintsun seagull a zahirce ba makera bane, bayani na karya ne.

A zahirce, wannan danganta ka tsakanin gaskiya da hakikan gaskiya na bukatan yare da hankalin mu dangane da ra’ayin.

Idan babu wani abu da zamu ce, kuma baka fahimci komai dana rubuta ba, wannan jimlar dana rubuta daidai yake da shirme, kuma zamu iya cewa “jita-jita” ne.

Assuming you can tell the difference between the above two fonts, we can reasonably continue.

#### Accuracy And Consistency

It is impossible for me to accurately paint a cloud, since in the time it takes to paint it, the cloud continually changes. I can accurately paint a *photograph* of a cloud, which has become frozen in time.

If I spend an hour trying to paint a cloud, and then I ask you whether or not my painting is an accurate representation of that cloud, you must necessarily reply that it is not.

In other words, where there is no consistency, there can be no accuracy.

When we dream at night, our perceptions are that the rules of “matter” and “energy” are in a constant state of flux – we are immune to gravity, and then we fly on the back of an elephant, and then we can walk through walls. It is no more possible to develop a “scientific physics of dreams” than it is to accurately paint a cloud.

Logic, science and truth, then, are impossible in the absence of *consistency*.

Fundamentally, the laws of logic are derived from the behaviour of matter and energy, at least at the perceptual level. If I tell you to throw a ball both up and down at the same time, I am asking for the impossible, which you can easily test by attempting to fulfil my request. If I tell you to plough both the north field and the south field simultaneously, you will be unable to comply. If I demand that you turn a rose into a donkey, my demand will never be met.

Perceptual reality is consistent and objective – and it is from this consistency and objectivity that we derive the laws of logic. Our statements about reality can only accurately *represent* reality as a direct result of this consistency and objectivity.

The fact that seagulls do not arbitrarily turn into anvils – or vice versa – is the root of our capacity to accurately judge the statement: “That is a seagull.” If seagulls spontaneously and continually changed their nature, we would be unable to make either true or false statements regarding them – or anything for that matter.

This is the root of a key criterion of the scientific method – reproducibility. If I make a universal claim about the nature of gravity, then you should be able to reproduce that claim in your own environment. If reality were *not* consistent, then reproducibility would be an irrational criterion for the establishment of truth.

If you were a maths teacher, you would be very unlikely to accept a wrong answer from a student, even if that student claimed that his answer was “right” when he wrote it down, but just somehow changed in the interim.

Thus we can accept that we must measure the validity of a statement relative to objective reality – both empirically, and logically. Logic as a discipline arises only as a result of the consistency of reality; empirical observations are also valid or invalid only as a result of the consistent nature of reality.

### The Existence Of "Truth"

Truth, then, can be measured according to two central criteria:

1. Truth is a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the consistency of rationality, which is directly derived from the consistent behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^2]
2. Truth is also a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the nature and behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^3]

The first criterion is a measure of the consistency of ideas with themselves – and such consistency is a requirement because reality is consistent with itself. If I say, “I do not exist,” that is an example of an idea that is inconsistent with itself, since I must exist in order to utter the sentence. The second criterion is a measure of the accuracy of ideas relative to empirical observations of objective reality.

#### Empiricism Versus Rationality

Empiricism can be thought of as the ability to instinctively catch a thrown ball, or measure its movement; rationality is the ability to predict and understand the path that ball will take based on universal principles. Clearly, if balls randomly went in any and every direction – and magically transformed into flocks of doves to boot – we would be utterly unable to predict their behaviour.

Thus, since matter obeys immutable laws, our theories *about* matter must also obey immutable laws. If I know nothing about baseball, but watch a baseball game where the players always obey the rules, it would be irrational for me to formulate a theory about the rules of baseball that directly contradicted the behaviour of the players I was watching. Since the actions of the players are consistent, *any theory I develop regarding the rules that guide those actions must also be consistent*.

This requirement for consistency is one of the most basic requirements for truth. Since reality is consistent, theories regarding reality must also be consistent.

In fact, the first hurdle that any theory must overcome is that of *internal consistency*.

[^1]: If you do not value truth, you would never be in this debate – or any other debate – in the first place!

[^2]: Rational consistency, or internal logic.

[^3]: Empirical evidence, or empiricism.
