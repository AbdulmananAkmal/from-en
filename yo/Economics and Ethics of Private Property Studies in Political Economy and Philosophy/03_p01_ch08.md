## Awujo: Ohun-ini tabi Imoye Imo?

Ni awon orisirisi awon iwe ti o sese wa ni * Atunwo ti Oro-okowo Austrian, * Joseph Salerno bere si da awon idaniloju aje ati awujo ti o ni igbagbo pelu Ludwig von Mises ati Friedrich A. Hayek. Ni pato, o ti fi han pe awon oju won lori awujosepo ni o yato patapata, ati pe o ti jiyan pe ariyanjiyan atileba ti Mises ni eyiti a npe ni isiro awujopo awujo je isaro gbogbo ati pe o je oro ikehin, lakoko ti Hayek se ipinnu pato si Jomitoro je otito lati inu ibere ati pe o kun afikun ipile. Akosile atele yoo pese atileyin afikun si iwe-eko Salerno.

Iroyin ariyanjiyan ti o mo daradara ti Mises so eyi: Ti ko ba si ohun-ini ti ara eni ni ile ati awon okunfa nkan miiran, lehinna nibe tun le je owo tita fun won. Nibi, isiro aje, itumo eyi, iseduro ti wiwole ti ifojusona ati iye owo ti o se ye ti a fihan ni awon ona ti pasipaaro isowo papo (eyi ti o fun laaye * iseduro awon iseduro ti iseduro), je eyiti ko se soro. Asise asaniloju ti Socialism ni isansa ti awon ohun-ini ti ara eni ni ile ati awon nkan ti o n se nkan, ati nipa ipinnu, awon isanwo ti isiro aje.

Fun Hayek, isoro ti socialism ko je aini sugbon aisi imo. Ikowe pato re je yato si yato si Mises. [^1] Fun Hayek, abawon ti igbimo-oro ni awujo ni otito pe imoye, paapaa "imo awon ipo pataki ti akoko ati ibi," wa nikan ni foomu ti o tuka pupo bi ohun-ini ti awon eni-kookan; nibi, o seese *dajudaju* ko seese lati pejo ati sise gbogbo imoye ti o wa tele ninu okan ti olutoju alakoso awujo kan nikan. Idaabobo Hayek kii se ohun-ini ara eni, sugbon ifasile ti lilo imo.

Sibe eyi je otito iwe-ipamo ti ko to. Ni akoko, ti o ba je pe iseduro ti imoye ni isoro naa, isoro naa ni o soro lati salaye idi ti awon idile, awon asale, ati awon ile-ise wa, ati idi ti won ko fi dojuko awon isoro kanna gege bi awon awujo. Awon idile ati awon ile-ise tun ni ipinnu eto igbogun. Olori ebi ati alakoso ile-ise naa tun se awon eto ti o se asopo awon lilo awon eniyan miiran le se imoye ti ara won, sibe awon idile ati awon ile ise ko mo lati pin awon isoro ti awuosepo. Fun Mises, akiyesi yii ko ni isoro: labe isinmi-ise eni ini ti ara eni * ko si *, lakoko ti awon idile ati awon ile-ikoko ti wa ni * da lori ile-ise * ti ohun-ini ikoko. Sibesibe, fun Hayek sise isise ti awon idile ati awon ile-ise je isoro nitoripe ero re ti awujo ti o ni kikun ti o je okan ninu eyiti olukuluku se ipinnu ara re ti o da lori imoye ti ara re ti awon ipo, ti a ko le salaye nipase eyikeyi eto isinmi tabi supraindividual (social) iwuwasi (bii ipile ti ohun-ini ikoko).

Keji, ti o ba je pe * desideratum * je isafihan ifasile ti imoye ni awujo, lehinna o nira lati salaye idi ti awon isoro ti awujosepo se pataki yato si awon ti o ni ipade nipase eyikeyi ona miiran ti awujo. * Gbogbo agbari ti eniyan, kopa bi o se je awon eni-kookan ototo, nigba gbogbo ati airotele se lilo imoye. Ni awujosepo, imoye ti a ti ni iyato ni a ko lo kere ju ni awon ile-ikoko tabi awon ile. Gege bi iduro, eto ti o wa ni aringbungbun wa labe isopo-ara eni, ati laarin awon idiwon ti eto yi, awon alamosepo ati awon alakoso ile-ise nlo imoye ti ara won nipa awon ipo ti akoko ati ibi lati se ati se eto naa. Fun Mises, gbogbo eyi je patapata legbee ojuami. Laarin ilana itupale Hayek, ko si iyato laarin awon awujosepo ati ajo aladani kan. Nitori naa, ko le je asise pelu alaposepo ju pelu aladani ikoko.

O han ni, akosile Hayek nipa isoro ti isaju ti isinisitije je aisedeede. Ohun ti o se iyato ti iyato si awujosepo lati awon ile-ise ati awon idile je * ko* ni idaniloju imoye ti a ti sagbe tabi aiyede lilo imoye ti a ti soto, sugbon dipo isinisi ohun-ini ti ara eni, ati nibi, awon owo. Ni otito, ni awon apejuwe die si Mises ati ariyanjiyan atileba re, Hayek ni awon igba han lati mo eyi, ju. Sugbon igbiyanju re lati sepo awon iwe-akoole ti arare pelu Mises ati nitorina o pese apere iyasoto titun ati giga.

Awon iyasoto Hayekian naa ni apapo apere imoran yii: "Ni pataki, ninu eto ti o ti mo awon otito ti o ye fun opolopo awon eniyan, awon owo le sise lati sakoso awon ise iyato ti awon eniyan yato" ati "eto owo" le sin gegebi "siseto fun alaye alaye." [^2] Lakoko ti abala keji ti idaniloju yi kolu okan bi Misesian ti o yago, o je ohunkohun sugbon ko o bi o ti je iseduro pelu isawari akoko, ayafi nipase ipase eda ti Hayek ti "awon owo" pelu "Alaye" ati "imo." Sibesibe, apejo yii je die e sii ju etan toloju ju idaniloju lo. Ni ekan, o je laiseniyan lati so ti owo bi kiko alaye. Won so nipa awon ipolowo pasipaaro ti o koja, sugbon o je alaileko lati pari pe isoro ti socialism je ailoju * imo*. Eyi yoo tele awon ti o ba je iye owo gangan *wiwa* alaye.

While it is certainly true that such knowledge exists, and while it is also true that uniquely private knowledge can never be centralized (without information losses), it is just as certainly *not* true that the knowledge of prices falls into this category of uniquely *private* information. To be sure, prices are “prices paid at specific times and places,” but this does not make them private information in the Hayekian sense. To the contrary, the information conveyed by *prices* is *public* information, because prices—*qua* objective exchange ratios—are *real* events. It may be *difficult* to know all of the prices paid at a specified date and location, just as it may be difficult to know every person’s physical location at any given time. Yet it is hardly *impossible* to know either one, and with current computer technology it is probably easy. In any case, while I may never know everything that you know, and *vice versa*, it is no more problematic to assume that both of us can simultaneously possess the same *price* information than that we can both simultaneously know the same baseball results. Hence, the knowledge conveyed by prices actually *can be centralized*. However, if price information is public information and thus can be centralized, then, according to Hayek’s thesis that socialism’s problem stems from the inefficiency of trying to centralize genuinely uncentralizable private knowledge, it would follow that the absence of prices, and hence of private property has *nothing to do* with the plight of socialism. Otherwise, if one insists with Mises that the absence of private property, and prices *does* have something to do with the plight of socialism, Hayek’s contribution to the socialism debate must be discarded as false, confusing, and irrelevant.

Hayek’s misconception of the nature of socialism is symptomatic of a fundamental flaw in his thinking, pervading not only his economics but in particular also his political philosophy: his ultra-subjectivism. Hayek, as noted and quoted *ad nauseam* by his numerous followers, was convinced that “it is probably no exaggeration to say that every important advance in economic theory during the last hundred years was a further step in the consistent application of subjectivism.”[^4] While this may well be true, it does not logically follow that every further advance toward subjectivism must also lead to an advance in economic theory. However, Hayek seems to have drawn this conclusion and has thus become a prime example illustrating its falsehood.

Mises, and in his steps even more clearly Murray N. Rothbard, conceives of economics as the science of human *action*. Action has two inseparable aspects: a subjective aspect (action is rational, intelligible action) and an objective aspect (acting is always acting with real things and physical stuff). Accordingly, Mises’s and Rothbard’s economics and political philosophy is never anything but robust, and their categories and theories invariably possess real, operational meaning: private property, division of labor based on private property, production, direct and indirect exchange, and compulsory interference with private property and production and exchange such as taxation, counterfeiting, legislation, and regulation.

In distinct contrast, Hayek—and misled by him to different degrees also Israel Kirzner and Ludwig Lachmann—views economics as some sort of science of human *knowledge*. Accordingly, Hayek’s categories and theories refer to purely subjective phenomena and are invariably elusive or even illusory. He is not concerned about acting with things but about knowledge and ignorance, the division, dispersion, and diffusion of knowledge, alertness, discovery, learning, and the coordination and divergence of plans and expectations. The external (physical) world and real (material) events have almost completely disappeared from his view. Hayek’s categories refer to *mental* states of affairs and relationships, completely detached from and compatible with *any* real physical state of affairs and events.

Most notable and disturbing is the ultra-subjectivist turn in Hayek’s political philosophy. According to a long-standing tradition of political philosophy shared by Mises and Rothbard, freedom is defined as the freedom to privately own and control real property, and coercion is the initiation of physical damage upon the private property of others. In distinct contrast, Hayek defines freedom as “a state in which each can use his own *knowledge* and for his own *purposes*,”[^5] and coercion means “such control of the environment or circumstances of a person by another that, in order to avoid greater evil, he is forced to act not according to a coherent plan of his own but to serve the *ends* of another,”[^6] or alternatively, “coercion occurs when one man’s actions are made to serve another man’s will, not for his own but for the other’s *purpose*”[^7] (all emphases mine). Clearly, Hayek’s definition contains no reference to scarce goods and real tangible property, and provides no *physical* criterion or indicator whatsoever for the existence or nonexistence of either state of affairs. Rather coercion and freedom refer to specific configurations of subjective wills, plans, thoughts, or expectations. As *mental* predicates, Hayek’s definitions of freedom and coercion are compatible with every *real*, physical state of affairs.[^8]

It is beyond the scope of this note to offer a detailed critique and refutation of Hayek’s ultra-subjectivism. However, in addition to the fundamental question whether a science of knowledge as envisioned by Hayek is even possible (i.e., whether there can be any other science of knowledge apart from logic and epistemology on the one hand and the history of ideas on the other),[^9] two conclusions are painfully clear. Even if Hayek’s science of knowledge is possible, it appears at best irrelevant because it is praxeologically meaningless. At worst it is intellectually pernicious in promoting relativism.

As for the real world of acting with physical property, of production and exchange, of money and markets, of profits and losses, of capital accumulation and of bankruptcies, there can be no lasting doubt about the existence of *laws* and the ceaseless operation of a *tendency* toward general equilibrium (action-coordination). Likewise, there can be no doubt about the existence of laws and the constant operation of dis-equilibrating tendencies within the world of actual taxation, counterfeiting, legislation, and regulation. Indeed, it would be extremely costly, even prohibitive, to not recognize such laws and tendencies and to adopt relativistic views. In contrast, in surreptitiously shifting attention from the tangible world of action and property to the ethereal world of knowledge, ideas, plans and expectations, relativistic views become attractive and cheap. There are no apparent regularities and tendencies in Hayek’s knowledge world. In fact, it is difficult to even imagine what “law” and “equilibrium” could possibly mean in the context of purely subjective phenomena. Instead there appears to exist nothing but constant kaleidoscopic change.

It is hardly surprising then that Hayek and his followers could proclaim such relativistic slogans as that we cannot do anything to improve our condition except rely on spontaneous evolution, that our future is completely unknowable, or that we cannot but participate in an endless and open-ended stream of conversation. As far as the realm of purely subjective phenomena is concerned and as addressed to a purely spiritual disembodied being, this may well be good advice. However, why would anyone with a bodily existence even care? As applied to the world of bodily action and property, such advice is self-destructive nonsense.
